* [**Relational Database**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M3-L1-RelationalDBs-Handout.pdf)
	
	* Relational database are the most common way to persistently store data in web applications. A database is used to store a collection of relations (table). Each row in a table correspond to one "record".

	* Each table has a "primary key" that serve as the unique identifier of the record.

	* We can "**normalize**" the database by creating additional/separate out tables so we don't have records that are 'almost identifical' except a few fields.

		* To get back the same data as in the de-normalized tabels, we join the "**foreign key**" of normalized table 1 to the primary key of another, normalized table 2.

	* The structure/organization of the tables in a database is referred to as "**schema**". We often use the "**entity-relationship model**" to abstractly capture a database schema.

	* When you have a many to many relationship, and you still want to normalize the table, you will need a "**join table**".


* [**Database in Rails**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M3-L2-RailsDBs-Handout.pdf)

	* Each time we ran the scaffold generator in our blog application, Rails created a database migration file and placed it in the db/migrate directory.

	* Rails uses the _rake_ command to run these migrations, which creates a schema, from which appropriate databases can then be created.

	* Migrations are timestamped, and executed in the order they were created. The filenames contain the timestamp.

	* Rails automatically sets up applications to run in one of three prebuilt environments: dev, test (staging), and production. The dev env uses SQLite, a simple easy-to-use file-based DB that runs in memory, it's not good for production. The common choice for production DB are PostgreSQL or MySQL.

* [** The Active Record Design Pattern**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M3-L3-ActiveRecords-Handout.pdf)

	* Active Records are commonly used in Ruby to access data stored in relational databases -- it allows you to perform CRUD operations without worrying about the specific underlying database technology (Abstractions!)

	* Most software applications are written using OO design and often it is necessary to persist the objects associated with these applications. The OO language are often incompatiable with the structure of relational database. But Active records solves that problem:
		* The design pattern encapsulates that notion an **object-relational mapping (ORM)**, a mapping between OO language objects and relational databases records.
		* This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within an OO language.

	* See slide 5/9 of the notes

	* Using the functionality provided by _ActiveRecord_, we can:
		* establish a db connection
		* create db tables
		* specify associations between tables
		* establish an ORM between Ruby classes/objects/attributes and the tables/rows/columns in the underlying db.
		* Perform CRUD operations on Ruby _ActiveRecord_ objects

	* The _ActiveRecord_ module is built into Rails:
		* ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection uses the info in ./config/database.yml to connect a Rails application to a db.
		* ActiveRecord::Migration is used to incrementally evolve your datbase schema over time. -- migration updates the ./db/schema.rb file.
		* ActiveRecord::Schema.define inspect the db and express its structure programmatically using a protable DSL.

	* If you create a new class by inheriting ActiveRecord:Base, it will pluralizes the name of the class, and then looks for a table with that name.

	* A query interace is also provided, so you don't have to write the actual (db dependent) SQL queries yourself.

* I'll skip the notes for 'association' and 'validation'. Watch the videos to follow along.
