### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "R Programming"

* **Week 3**:
	* [**lapply**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/lapply.pdf):
		
		Writing for, while loops is useful when programming but not particularly easy when working interactively on the command line. The *apply family is implemented so we can loop over objects easily.

		* Takes 1) a list x, 2) a function 3) other additional arguments to the function
		* lapply always returns a list, regardless of the class of the input
		* lapply and *apply use anonymous functions very heavily
		* sapply is like lapply (also take in a list), but it will try to simplify the result of lapply if possible
			* If the result is a list where every element is length 1, then a vector is returned
			If the result is a list where every element is a vector of the same legnth (>1), a matrix is returned
			* If it can't figure it out, a list is returned

	* [**apply**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/apply.pdf)
		* apply is used to evaluate a (often anonymous)function over the margins of an array (often a matrix, a special type of array)
		* rowSums = apply(x, 1, sum). rowMeans = apply(x, 1, mean). Similarly for colSums & colMeans

	* [**tapply**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/tapply.pdf)
		* tapply is used to apply a function over subset of a vector. _function(x, INDEX (often a factor), FUN, ..., simplify)_

	* [**split**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/tapply.pdf)
		* split takes a vector or other objects and splits it into groups determined by a factor or list of factors (slide 7/14) and always return a list
		* A common idiom is split (which returns a list) followed by an lapply = tapply
		* split a dataframe and use lapply to compute some statistics (slide 10/14) 
		* We can also split by more than 1 level/factor _split(x, list(f1,f2))_
		* The last two bullet points are basically ddply, but involve more steps

	* [**mapply**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/tapply.pdf)
		* mapply can be used to repeatedly apply a function with different combination of arguments
			* _function(FUN, ..., MoreArgs = NULL, SIMPLIFY = TRUE, USE.NAMES = TRUE)_
			* see slide 5/6 for a great example. mapply also allows you to *vectorize a function*!

	* [**Debugging I & II & III**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/debugging.pdf)
		* message -> warning -> error
		* _invisible()_ prevents auto-printing, often used as the last expression in a function definition (e.g. load use _invisible()_ to hide the loaded dataset)
		* Asking question about something went wrong!:
			* what was your input?
			* What were you expecting? what did you get? how does it differ from your expecation? (this is important for articulating why you think things went wrong)
			* Can you reproduce the problem

		Here are some useful debugging tools to use in R:

		* **traceback**: prints out the function call stack after an error occurs. You have use traceback immediately after you get an error
		* **debug**: flags a function for "debug" mode which allows you to step through execution of a function one line at a time
		* **browser**: suspends the execution of a function whereever it is called and puts the function in debug mode
		* **trace**: allows you to insert debugging code into a function a specific place
		* **recover**: allows you to modify the error behavior so that you can browse the function call stack
