### Notes for Today

Continue to explore Coursera: Web Application Architecture. However, since today is the first day returning from the 3 day labor day weekend, I am starting slow:

* [**Middleware + HTTP-rotocl**]
	
	* Middleware is the "software glue" between the operating system and applications on each side of a client-sider architecture, some refer it as the 'dash' in client-server.

	* HTTP is an application layer protocol used to deliver _resources_ in distributed hypermedia information systems. In a web application, the request initiates activities that are implemented over the middleware. and the response typically involves returning resources to the browser. The resources delivered as part of this protocol include:
		* Hypertext - HTML documents, possibly styled with CSS
		* Hypermedia - graphics, audio, video
		* Hyerlink - define a structure over the web (Google!)
		* Scripts - code that can be executed on the client side, but might be sent from server.

	* HTTP is stateless -- this refers to the fact that the protocol does not require the server to retain information related to prevoius client requests. i.e. each client request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the client requests that preceded it.
		* Cookies, sessions, URL encoded parameters and a few other technologies have been introduced to address this issue

	* HTTP - Request

	* HTTP - Response
