### Notes for Today

Continue to explore Coursera: Web Application Architecture. However, since today is the first day returning from the 3 day labor day weekend, I am starting slow:

* [**Middleware + HTTP-rotocl**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L2-HTTP-Handout.pdf)
	
	* Middleware is the "software glue" between the operating system and applications on each side of a client-sider architecture, some refer it as the 'dash' in client-server.


	* HTTP is an application layer protocol used to deliver _resources_ in distributed hypermedia information systems. In a web application, the request initiates activities that are implemented over the middleware. and the response typically involves returning resources to the browser. The resources delivered as part of this protocol include:
		* Hypertext - HTML documents, possibly styled with CSS, and containing references/hyperlinks to other hypertexts.
		* Hypermedia - graphics, audio, video
		* Hyerlink - define a structure over the web (Google!)
		* Scripts - code that can be executed on the client side, might be sent from server.

	* HTTP Background/History
		* HTTP/0.9 -- only get requests
		* HTTP/1.0 -- incldue request header + additional request types
		* HTTP/1.1 -- Similar to 1.0, but contains a lot of speed optimization

	* HTTP is stateless
		* This refers to the fact that the protocol does not require the server to retain information related to prevoius client requests.
		* Each client request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the client requests that preceded it. 
		* This made if very difficult for web application to respond intelligently to user input (i.e. to create the interactivity that users expect), so additional technology has been developed:
			* Cookies, sessions, URL encoded parameters and a few other technologies have been introduced to address this issue, allowing the emergence of web 2.0 and 3.0
	
	* HTTP session
		* An HTTP client (browser) establishes a TCP connection to a host server on a particular port (typically port 80), and initiates a request. Establishing the TCP connection may first involve using a DNS server in order to obtain an IP address
		* An HTTP server listening on that port waits for a client's request.
		* Upon receiving the request, the server processes it and sends back a statu line, along with a message of its own (response), the body of which might be a requested resource, and error message, or some other information.


	* [**HTTP - Request**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L3-HTTP-Request-Handout.pdf): An HTTP/1.1 request message consists of three parts:

		* **Request line**:
			
			* The request line identifies the resource, along with the desire action that should apply to it. There are 9 different actions: HEAD, GET, POST, PUT< DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT, PATCH.

				* HEAD, GET, OPTIONS, TRACE are referred to as _safe method_. Safe methods should not produce side effects on the server, and are only intended for information retrieval.

				* In contrast, POST, PUT, DELETE methods may cause side effects on the server, they are not safe methods. They are, however, _idempotent_, which means that multiple requests should have the same effect as a single request. (think about delete).
					* safe methods have this property too, they always return the same thing, so multiple request should have the same effect as a single request.

		* **Header**:

			* Primary part of an HTTP request. Header fields start with the field name, followed by a colon, and then the field value.
				* Accept: text/plan (client accpet text/plain)
				* Accept-Language: en-US (client accept english, this is how we internationalize an application)
				* See Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for the set of core fields

			* Header must be separated from the message body by a blank line.

		* ** Message Body**:

			* The message body in HTTP request is optional.
			* It typically includes user-entered data or files that are being uploaded to the server. It also defines various characteristics of the dat athat is being requested.


	* [**HTTP - Response**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L4-HTTP-Respnose-Handout.pdf)

		* **Responde line**:

			* The first line of the response provided by the server, it is called the _status line_. It consist of three parts:
				* The HTTP version (HTTP/1.1)
				* A statu code (200)
				* An english reason phrase describing the status code. (OK)

			* Status code:
				* 1xx (provisional response): require requestor to take additional actions.
				* 2xx (successful)
				* 3xx (redirected)
				* 4xx (request error)
				* 5xx (server error)

		* **Header**: allow the server to pass additional information about the response which can't be placed in the status line. This is in the same format as request headers.

		* **Message body**:

			* message body must be preceded by a blank line
			* The response to a HEAD request does not include a message body, all other response do, although it may be of zero length.
			* The requested resource, typically an HTML
