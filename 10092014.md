#### Doing Data Science

I managed to go through Chapter 3 (Algorithm) and almost all Chapter 4 (Naive Bayes) this week. A few observations:

* The reading of this book is casual, easy to follow, fun
* It's more of a philosophy book, not a technical book, so don't expect to learn the details of a technique
* There are occasionally good concepts, and explanations to things I already know. Internalize those
* Because it's more philosophical, I find it harder to document my learning and absorption here for technical side of things.

Keep learning and see what you learned.


#### Stanford CS 183B: How to start a start-up: Lecture 6: Alex Schultz: VP of Growth @Facebook

Overall, a very entertaining lecture, as it is super relevant for what I am doing now. I haven't yet to find a good summary (maybe summarize it myself) of this lecture. But a few nice good complementary materials:

* [How we put Facebook on the path to 1 billion users]: From the legendary Chamath Palihapitiya, who brings FB from 500M to 1B, and he talks about the magic number and the magic moments.
* [Growth Accounting & Triangle Heatmap]: This is what Charles was talking about, and I first handly witnessed how this helped Twitter
* [Startup = Growth]: It explains the essence of start-up and how growth is related to all activities of start-up:
	* making something a lot of people want
	* reach and serve all these people 

_"If you want to understand startups, understand growth. Growth drives everything in this world. Growth is why startups usually work on technology â€” because ideas for fast growing companies are so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source of rapid change. Growth is why it's a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not just because the returns are high but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than generating returns from dividends. Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it lets them choose their growth rate. And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers. To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too."_
