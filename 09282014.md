### Notes for Today

#### Summary of Chapter 12 (skip ch.11): Introduction to Linux

* The **IP** (internet Protocol) address is a unique logical network address that is assigned to a device on a network
* **IPv4** uses 32-bits for adresses and **IPv6** uses 128-bits for addresses
* Every IP address contains both a network and a host address field
* There are five classes of network addresses available: A, B, C, D & E
* **DNS** (Domain Name System) is used for converting internet domain and host names to IP addresses
* The **ifconfig** program is used to display current active network interfaces
* You can use **ping** to check if the remote host is alive and responding
* You can use the **route** utility program to manage IP routing
* Non-graphical or text browsers used in Linus are Lynx, Links, and w3m
* You can **wget** to downlaod webpages. You can use **curl** to obtain information about URL's
* **scp** allows you to securely transfer file between machines
* You can use **ssh** to run commands on remote system.

Is this summary helpful. It seems most of these things I already know, and I am just writing it because I want to commit the notes for today. Not a good mentality.

#### Other materials

* [VUD Lab]: This is a group of Civil Engineering Ph.D students at Berkeley, who are responsible for creating:
	* Bart Strike Data
	* Simpson's Paradox visualization

They have a nice "Learn" section that gives some pointers to where to learn d3.js.

* [NY Times: TheUpshot]: I think this is where a lot of Mike Bostock's d3.js visualization are presented on NY Times.

* [Request in d3]: An API reference doc on how to process requests. I think requests can be thought as requests for external data?.

* For searching how d3.js works with database, perhaps stackoverflow with search query: d3.js + database is your best option.
	* So far, it still seems like php option is the most clear one to me
	* I searched through the company code based, it's a bit hard to find a easy, concrete example. I should probably reach out to the data viz team to learn more.
	* It also doesn't seem producing a dashboard with search box that reads data from a database would be a trivial tasks. How can I break things to smaller chunk ot hack/build bits by bits?
