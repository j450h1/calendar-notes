### Notes for Today

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 11](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch11.html): Today's chapter is about **layout**. Contrary to what the name implies, D3 layouts do not, in fact, lay anything out for you on the screen. The layout methods have no direct visual output. Rather, D3 layouts take data you provided and remap or otherwise transform it, thereby generating _new_ data that is more convenient for a specific visual task. It's still up to you to tak that new data and generate visuals from it.

	* [**Many examples on the D3 website**](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)
	
	* [**The official API documentation**](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Layouts)

	* In this chapter, we introduce 3 layouts:
		* Pie layout
		* Stack Chart layout
		* Force firected graph layout

	Chances are I am not going to remember the details, and will have to refer back to the example code again. I think the important thing here to try to load the examples, see how dataset was transformed after applying layouts on them.
