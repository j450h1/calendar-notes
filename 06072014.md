### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/index.htm): Finished lecture 5 and 6.
     * **Lecture 5 (Objects in Python)**: Topics covered: Tuples, lists, dictionaries, methods, identifiers, modifying objects, aliasing, mutability. 
     Objects introduced here are not new to me. It's a good lecture to remind me again the concept of mutability (tuples are immutable, lists/dicts are mutable). Mutable objects can be mutated by methods, which have side effects of modifying the objects. Immutable objects cannot be changed.
     	* **Assignment**: Assignment has to do with binding a name (identifiers) to an object. Immutable objects are often assigned, and cannot be modified.
     	* **Mutation**:  Mutation has to do with changing the value of an object (via a method call). Aliasing can be dangerous because multiple names can point to the same object.
     Assignment and Mutation can happened in a series of operation that cause confusions (many good examples). I think the key to master these is to draw the pointer pictures (Philip Guo's Python Tutor really helps!).
     * **Lecture 6**: Oh, dear recursion. Divide and Conquer, Tower of Hanoi, base case, Fibonacci sequence. I always have to wrap my head around this concept.
     	* **Divide and Conquer**: 
     		* Smaller problems are easier to solve
     		* Solutions to the smaller problems can be _easily_ combined to solve the larger problem
     	* **Recursion**:
     		* A way of describing problems (using subproblems)
     		* A way of designing solutions

## Coursera Data Science Series: "Exploratory Data Analysis"

* **(Week 1)**: Having gone through all the videos, I don't think it makes sense to document on a per video basis. I am just going to list out the major concepts:
	* **Principles of Analytic Graphics**:
		* Principle 1: Show comparison -- always ask compared to what?
		* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
		* Principle 3: Show multivariate data, or use small multiples to show different dimensions
		* Principle 4: Integration of evidence. Use many modes of data representation
		* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
		* Principle 6: Content is King -- it ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content

	* **Plotting Systems in R**:
		* Base: "Artist's palette" model. Base graphics are usually constructed piecemeal, with each aspect of the plot handled separately through a series of function calls; this is often conceptually simpler and allows plotting to mirror the thought process
		* Lattice: Lattice graphics are usually created in a single function call, so all of the graphics parameters have to speciÔ¨Åed at once; specifying everything at once allows R to automatically calculate the necessary spacings and font sizes
		* ggplot2: combines concepts from both base and lattice graphics but uses an independent implementation

	* **Graphics Device**:
		* A graphics device is something where you can make a plot appear. It could a screen device on your laptop, a PDF file, a PNG or JPEG file. To find the current device, use _dev.cur()_. To set the current device, use _dev.set()_.            

* **(Week 2)**: Major topics are _Lattice Plotting System_ and _ggplot2 System_
    * [**Lattice**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/PlottingLattice.pdf):
        * Lattice function generally takes the form _xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data)_
            * The first part is a formula: y ~ x means we are plotting y against x
            * The | means _conditioning_, and is the syntax that creates small multiples
            * f * g are categorical variables where the small multiples should be created (similar to facet in ggplot2)
            * The second part is just the data set being used.
        * Lattice panel function: this function controls what happens inside of each individual plot 
    Lattice plots are constructed with a single function call. Aspects like margins and spacing are automatically adjusted. The lattice system is ideal for creating conditional plots where you examine the same kind of plot under many conditions. Panel function can be specified/customized to modify what happens in each of the plot panel.

    * [**ggplot2**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/ggplot2.pdf)
        * In brief, the grammar tells us that a statistical graphic is a **mapping** from data to **aesthetic** attributes (colour, shape, size) of **geometric** objects (points, lines, bars). The plot may also contain statistical transformations of the data and is drawn on a specific coordinate system.
        * **qplot**: stands for quick plot. Behaves very similarly like plot in base plot. 
            * The formula generally looks like _qplot(x, y, data, color/fill, geom, [method], facet)
            * The factor variables are generally used directly for plotting, so good naming of the factor is a good practice
        * **ggplot**: Basic component
            * data frame
            * aesthetic mappings: Important to remember if the aesthetic is assign to a constant, just use _color = "steelblue"_. However, if the aesthetic is map to a data variable, need to wrap it using _aes(color = data.variable)_
            * geoms
            * facets
            * stats
            * scales
            * coordinate system

            * Plots are build up in layers
                * Plot the data (e.g. actual data points)
                * Overlay a summary (e.g. using loess or lm to fit a line)
                * Metadata and annotation
    This is a section that's hard to summarize, because there are so many details, and I am not likely to remember everything. I think the important thing is remember the big conceptual things, and use google to search for actual syntaxes.

## Other Misc Materials

* **How to upgrade R studio version?**: It turns out that you have to upgrade the R version, and R Studio will be upgraded automatically, check out this [thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13656699/update-r-using-rstudio) for more explanation. I wanted to use this because I want to explore rCharts.
* [**rCharts**](http://rcharts.io/): Pretty Cool. I ran a very basic simple example, and the interactive visualization (using d3.js) just pop out from RStudio.
    * It has the capability to create interactive data visualization, like many of the ones created by javascript plotting libraries such as d3.js
    * You can also embedded an rChart into RShiny, to make things more interactive.
