### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/index.htm): Finished lecture 5 and 6.
     * **Lecture 5 (Objects in Python)**: Topics covered: Tuples, lists, dictionaries, methods, identifiers, modifying objects, aliasing, mutability. 
     Objects introduced here are not new to me. It's a good lecture to remind me again the concept of mutability (tuples are immutable, lists/dicts are mutable). Mutable objects can be mutated by methods, which have side effects of modifying the objects. Immutable objects cannot be changed.
     	* **Assignment**: Assignment has to do with binding a name (identifiers) to an object. Immutable objects are often assigned, and cannot be modified.
     	* **Mutation**:  Mutation has to do with changing the value of an object (via a method call). Aliasing can be dangerous because multiple names can point to the same object.
     Assignment and Mutation can happened in a series of operation that cause confusions (many good examples). I think the key to master these is to draw the pointer pictures (Philip Guo's Python Tutor really helps!).
     * **Lecture 6**: Oh, dear recursion. Divide and Conquer, Tower of Hanoi, base case, Fibonacci sequence. I always have to wrap my head around this concept.
     	* **Divide and Conquer**: 
     		* Smaller problems are easier to solve
     		* Solutions to the smaller problems can be _easily_ combined to solve the larger problem
     	* **Recursion**:
     		* A way of describing problems (using subproblems)
     		* A way of designing solutions
