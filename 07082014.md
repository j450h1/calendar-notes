### Notes for Today

## Interesting Materials from Twitter Hackweek (From Work)

* [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html)
	* I started to explore Full Stack Python, which I originally found on HN. I thought this is a interesting website, because it teaches how to use Python to build 'web application', my goal, is to:
		* Get myself more familiar with Python
		* Get myself a basic understanding of what it takes to build a web application
		* Twitter also teaches flask, so I want to learn what it is
	* [Jeff Knupp's introduction to what is a web framework?](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/)
		* It gives an overview of how web framework is vital in creating a web application
	* [Kate Heddleston's introduction to Full-Stack Python web application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uxQOzKi3_0#t=35)
		* It gives a great overview of what is the 'stack' needed to create a web application
		* It also talk about dev-staging-test-prod. 'System of systems' idea.
	* [A lot of cool Python packages](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#machine-learning)
