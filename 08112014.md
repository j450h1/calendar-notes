### Notes for Today

## Today's session: Evalute potential new classes: "Web Application Architectures"

* **Module 1**:
	* [**Historical timeline and web 1.0, 2.0, 3.0**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M1-L1-HistoricalPerspective-Handout.pdf)
		
		* web 1.0: creation of static web sites, the first web business model
		* web 2.0: interactivity (Ajax), social networking, mash-ups, media sharing, online commerce, lightweight collaborations, wiki
		* web 3.0: The "intelligent web": machine-faciliated understanding of information. e.g. semantic web, NLP, machine learning, recommender system.

	* [**client server model**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M1-L2-WhatIsAWebApp-Handout.pdf)
		
		* The client-sever model consists of two parts:
			* _server componenet_: "listen" for request, and **provide** service and/or resources accordingly
			* _client componenet_: establishes a connection to the server, and **requests** services and/or resources from it

		* Ofthen the server is the web server, client is the browser, and the network in between client & server is the HTTP protocol

		* Definition of a web application: A web application is accessed by users over a network, uses a browser as the client, and consists of a collection of client and server side scripts, HTML pages, and other resources that may be spread across multiple servers. The applciation itself is accessed by users via a specific path within a web server e.g. www.amazon.com.

		* Network: it's basically the internet, that use the standard TCP/IP protocol

		* World Wide Web is a system of interlinked documents accessed via the internet using HTTP. Hyperlinks give the web its structure.

	* [**Web Application Architecture**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M1-L4-DesignPatterns-Handout.pdf)

		* see here to see the schematic of web 1.0 v.s. web 2.0/3.0 [**web application architecture**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M1-L3-Web123-Handout.pdf)

		* Definition (Design Pattern): A design pattern is a description of interacting objects and classes that interact to solve a general design problem within a particular context. A design pattern is an abstract template that can be applied over and over again. 

		* The _n-tier architecture_ is a design pattern based on the concept of breaking a system into different pieces or tiers that can be physically separated: each tier is responsible for providing a specific functionality. A tier only interacts with the tiers adjacent to it through a well-defined interface.

		* One of the most common is the 3-tier architecture:
			
			* **Presentation tier**: the user interace (e.g. web browser)
			
			* **Application (logic) tier**: retrieves, modifies and/or deletes data in the data tier, and sends the results to the presentation tier (e.g. the web server and logic associated with generating dynamic web content)
				
				* business logic sub-tier: models the business objects associated with the application (e.g. accounts, inventories...etc)
				* data access sub-tier: responsible for accessing data, and passing it to the business logic (e.g. account balances, transactions...etc)
			
			* **Data tier**: the source of the data associated with the application. (e.g. a database)
				* client sub-tier: client-side user interace components
				* presentation logic sub-tier: server-side scripts for generating web pages.

			* Finally, we got the **web tier**.
