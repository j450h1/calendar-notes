### Notes for Today

## [Coursera: Statistical Inference (finished)](http://bcaffo.github.io/courses/06_StatisticalInference/03_06_resampledInference/#1)
	
* **Resampling: Jackknife**:
	
	* Jackknife: more lightweight compared to bootstrap
	* The idea: The jackknife deletes each observation and calculates an estimate based on the remaining n-1 of them
	* It uses this collection of estimates to do things like estimate the bias and the standard error
	* See page 5/21 how bias and standard error are calculated
	* _library(bootstrap); temp <- jackknife(x, median); c(temp$jack.bias, temp$jack.se)_ does the same job
	* Generally, **do not** use the jackknife for sample quantiles like the median; as it has been shown to have some poor properties

* **Resampling: bootstrap**:
	
	* Scenario: I have a statistic that estimates some population parameter, but I don't know its sampling distribution. The bootstrap principle suggests using the distribution defined by the data to approximate its sampling distribution.
		* First, simulate complete data sets from the observed data with replacement
		* Calculate the statistic for each simulated data set
		* Use the simulated statistics to get the approx sampling distribution, construct confidence interval or take the standard deviation to calculate a standard error

* **Permutation Test**:
	
	* Consider the null hypothesis that the distribution of the observations from each group is the same. Then, **the group labels are irrelevant.**
	* We then discard the group levels and permute the combined data
	* Split the data into two groups A and B
	* Calculate a test statistic (e.g. difference of mean_A and mean_B)
	* Evaluate the probability of getting a statistic as large or larger than the one observed (p-value)
	* Many variation of this test (slide 19/21)
		* For paired/matched data (e.g. x_before & x_after), one can randomize the signs. For ranks, this results in the signed rank test. (i.e. rank should not correlate with sign)
		* **I am still confused the difference between signed rank test and rank sum test. See Stanford Notes for more details. You can also refer to Stat 135 notes**.

## [Coursera: Exploratory Data Analysis (finished)]()
	
* [**Working with Colors**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/RColors.pdf)
	
	* **colorRamp**: Take a pallette of colors and return a function that takes values between 0 and 1, indicating the extremes of the color palette. See slide 7,8/18
	
	* **colorRampPalette**: Take a palette of colors and return a function that takes integer arguments and returns a vector of colors interpolating the palette. See slide 9/18

	* **RColorBrewer**: Three types of palettes (see slide 11/18)
		* Sequential 
		* Diverging
		* Qualitative

	* Combine RColorBrewer and colorRampPalette. **very very handy**, see sldie 12/18

	* Transparency can sometimes be used to clarify plots with many points (using the argument alpha set between 0 and 1)

* **Case Study**: The case studies toward the end is very great. You should try to get yourself to that second nature of doing data analysis.
