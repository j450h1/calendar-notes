#### EdX: Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science

Knowing that Python is one of the most common tools in the DS toolkit, I have been waiting for this class for a long time, since it teaches both CS, Data Science using Python.

I know I promised myself not to over-commit, but I could resist to at least check out what this class is about. It's format, what will be covered.

Therefore, I used Today's time to go over the first lecture, and I think overall it's about the right level, and the teaching is good. There are occasionally extra videos from previous version of the class that you need to watch again, but that doesn't give me trouble.

Taking a step back, I think I want to focus on Python next year as a computational tool (just to switch it up and learn more about computational tools), and this class can be a good start, along with a lot of other great resources for doing data analysis in Python (instead of R)

Today's topic are essentially about plotting:

* It introduces `pylab`
* It introduces the concept of keyword arguments in a function signature and how to use them properly
* A few more plotting trick like title, x/y-labels, legend, and format.
* It also demonstrated how to write a plotting function as a class (Got some review of Python OOP)
