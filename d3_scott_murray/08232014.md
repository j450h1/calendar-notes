### Notes for Today

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 12](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch12.html): This chapter is about geomapping, codes are [here](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/tree/master/chapter_12). Specifically, we learned:

	* **GeoJSON, a specific case of JSON files**:
		
		* GeoJSON is the JSON-based standard for encoding geodata for web applications.
		* In a typical GeoJSON style, we have an object type "FeatureCollection" as the key, followed by a value that is an array of "features" containing individual "feature objects". Each feature object contains type and geometry, under geometry we have specific coordinates of the path. See the structure from the textbook.
		* The convention is that longitude first, latitude second.
		* In case your cartographic skill are a bit rusty, here is how we remember which is which:
			* Latitude is fatitude, so they wrap around the earth's waist, so it's horizontal.
			* Longtitude is long, so they are vertical.

	* **Paths**: 
		
		* Using _d3.geo.path()_ to construct SVG _path generator_. It does all the dirty work of translating that mess of GeoJSON coordinates into even messier messes of SVG path codes.
		* _svg.selectAll("path").data(json.features).enter().append("path").attr("d", path)_ where _d_ is the path data attribute, and it refers to our path generator.

	* **Projection**:

		* Real world is 3d, projection help us to project 3d coordinates into a nice 2d space.
		* D3 has several built-in projection methods, 
		* Once you define the projection, make sure to reference it in d3.geo.path as _var path = d3.geo.path().projection(projection);_.
		* We can also shrink or expand projection using _.scale(1000)_. Default is 1000 px.

	* **Choropleth**:
		
		* Def: Choropleth are geomap with areas filled in with different values (light or dark) or colors to reflect associated data values. A classic example of election map "red state, blue state".
		* They are super-useful, bu have some inherent perceptual limitations. Because it uses _area_ to encode values, large areas with low density (e.g. Nevada) might be overrepresented visually, vice versa -- A standard choropleth does not represent per-capita values fairly.


		* d3.scale.quantize: act like a linear scale, but it outputs values from within a discrete range. These output values are often numbers or colors. This is useful for sorting values into "buckets". This is a common scale to use for choropleth.


		* The conventional way of reading GeoJSON for plotting is using _d3.json("filename", callback_function())_. If you don't remember this convention, read ["Handling Data Loading Errors"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch05.html#_data). Remember this call is _asynchronous_, meaning it won't prevent the rest of your code from running while the browser waits for that external file to load. So be aware of calling this external data somewhere else (it might not have been loaded).
			* In fact, d3.csv and d3.json can be use together in nested fashion. In this particular example, we use this nested construct to **join** datasets together:
			* Recall how we delay calling domain on the d3.scale.quantize until we have the data loaded in the callback function! This reinforces the notion that callbacks are _asynchronous_.
			* With this joined data, we can map data to visual elements as usual. (color-code state by agriculture productivity) 
		

		* The "adding points" section follows the same code pattern:
			* We first load in the data using d3.json or d3.csv
			* Once the data is loaded in the callback, we map data to visual elements (map population size with the radius of the circles).
		
	* **Acquring and Parsing Geodata**: I didn't really follow every single step in this section since it requires installing some command line tools (I'm lazy). The basic steps involve:
		* Finding shapefiles
		* Choose a resolution that you think it's appropriate for your data viz
		* Sometimes we want to simplify the shapes by choosing a worse resolution. Remember, we don't want to load data that are too large into the browser because the rendering time might be delayed.
		* Convert it into GeoJSON
		* With the GeoJSON file at hand, you can do all the things we learn in earlier section to visualize!

	* Sometimes existing knowledge might seem incomprehensible. A lot of time it's because you are reconstructing your knowledge base, in exchange for a more solid foundation.
	
	* Create metaphor, analogy, and story is powerful! It's often use in art, and very often in science. The advantage of these techniques is that it allows you to bind new concept with existing neural patterns, so you can better trace the new path. It also help you to get unblocked from Einstellung.
	
	* Experts internalize chunks, so when they are required to make rapid decision, they don't need to think of them and just able to act. Intelligence matters, but:
		* larger working memory means you can retain more things at once, but it also makes you harder to be creative
		* smaller working memory means you have to be more retentive when focusing, but you have better ability to connect different chunks.
	
	* Change your thoughts, change your life ?
	
	* The value of teamwork ?:
		* Left brain: cling on making a particular interpretation of world force/view. 
		* Right brain: The devil's advocate, that checks for global inconsistency 
	
	* Test taking checklist:
		* Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
		* Did you work with classmates on homework problems?
		* Did you attempt to outline each homework question before discussing it with classmates?
		* Did you participate actively in homework group discussions?
		* Did you consult with the instructor/teach assistants when you were having trouble?
		* Did you understand all of your hoemwork problem solutions before the assignment was handed in?
		* Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problems that were unclear to you?
		* If you had a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you understood all of the material?
		* Did you go over the study guide with classmates to quiz one another?
		* If there were to be a review session, did you attend and ask questions about any concepts or ideas that you were unsure of?
		* Did you have a good night sleep before the test?
	
	* Hard start - jump to easy technique for testing taking! Must have self-discipline to switch
