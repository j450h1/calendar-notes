### Notes for Today

During the labor day weekend, I came across the Harvard Visualization class (CS 171). There are several reaons in which this class is appealing to me:
	* It's about data visualization
	* It's teaching visualization in d3.js, and it uses Scott Murray's book (which I finished) as the official textbook. It seems like this can be a natural extension of what I have been working on during weekends.
	* The professor who teaches this course also happen to be the co-professor of CS 109 (Data Science)
	* I always have a good experience with the _labs_ section of these classes

As a result, I decided to explore this course, and today is my first time investing in learning about the class. Here are some of essential links to the course:

* [**CS 171 - Visulaization**](http://www.cs171.org/#!index.md)
* [**CS 171 - Github**](https://github.com/CS171/repositories)

For today's exploration, I focus on lab 1, which is an introduction to Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The github link to [**lab 1**](https://github.com/CS171/lab1) is available. Here is the README.md intro:

In this lab we will cover the fundamentals of what you need to get started wth web programming. 
  - HTML provides the structural layer of the web experience
  - CSS provides the presentational layer of a page
  - Javascript provides interaction with the page.

The presentation slides used in the labs are [**attached**](https://github.com/CS171/lab1/blob/master/Lab1.pdf). Topics include basics of HTMl, Javascript, CSS, and quick introduction to SVG and libraries ([jQuery], [d3.js], and [Twitter Bootstrap]).

I think this lab so far is at about the right level compared to my own knowledge, easy to follow, but I can also learn some stuff. If I do commit to this class, I might need to make some decisions:

* Should I watch the lectures as well?
* Should I just watch the labs and follow along?
* Should I do the homework? Should I do them over weekends? or should I start building my own d3.js projects?

#Misc

Looking at other people's github repo is great, I learned today how to embedded codes, basically you use 1 backtick (inline) or 3 backtick for individual section (and you need to specify which language).

Here is my first example `d3.select()`.

Here is my second example

```javascript
d3.select()
```
