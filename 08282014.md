* [**ggplot2 redux**](http://rpubs.com/fawda123/ggpres_102): Someone's casual summary of some ggplot2 feature that are not available in base plotting system.

* **ggvis**:

* I also revisited Coursera: Reproducible Research Week 2. For notes, please refer to 06082014.md

* I watched the first two videos of week 3 materials. The first one talk about how to communicate and set up the structure for research paper/email communication. The second one talked about [**Rpubs**](https://rpubs.com/).

Keep an eye on RStudio, they consistently produce great R tools that expand the R ecosystem! Here is a [**list**](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/) of R packages related to RStudio. Here is the RStudio's [**online learning page**](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#Markdown).
