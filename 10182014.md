#### Coursera: Developing Data Product: Week 4: Building R packages & OOP in R

This marks as the last section of the last module of the Coursera Data Science Series.

* **Building R Packages**:
	* A R package is a collection of R functions, or other data objects that is created to extend the basic functionality of R. A well designed R package defines clearly the public interface for its API (how users will call the functions).
	
	* Primarily available from CRAN and Bioconductor (`install.packages()`), also available from github (`install_github()`).
	
	* **R package skeleton/essentials** - A R package is started by creating a dir with name of the R package (use `package.skeleton()` to start): 
		* A `DESCRIPTION` file which ahs info about the package
		* `R` code! There can be any number of files in the directory, but are usually separate out into logical groups.
		* `NAMESPACE` (optional) is used to indicate which functions are exported. (`export`, `exportClasses`, `exportMethods`)
			* Exported functions can be called by the user and are considered the public API.
			* Non-exported functions cannot be called directy by the user (but the code can be viewed)
			* Hides implementation details from the users
			* Can also indicate what functions you import from other packages (`import`, `importFrom`)
		* Documentation (in the `/man` subdirectory): required for every exported function. This is usually where the help file in ?function is constructed.
	
	* Once we have the R package, we need to build + check it before we deploy it! This steps is to ensure that anything uploaded to CRAN abides to a certain quality standard.

	* **R studio has a lot of helpers** for building a new R project:
		* `project menu -> new project -> new directory -> R package`, which will directly create the skeleton of a R package.
		* Then we proceed with coding in R
		* Once we have the R code, we can use this very helpful tool called `Roxygen 2` package that allows you to write documentation in the code itself (see the demo how this is done).
			* You only have to work on 1 file
			* The documentation is physically closer to the code, so you are less likely to make mistake
		* 'Build' tab will build the R package for you. 
		* Make sure in more -> configure build tool -> check `Generate documentation with Roxygen`.
		* use Build and reload to re-build the package
		* `check` will help you to make sure you pass all the checks.

	* **Classes and Methods in R**: Whenever we need to define a new data objects or new data structure for manipulating the data we are working with, we would create classes and methods.

		* Why writing new classes?
			* To represent new types of data
			* New concepts/ideas that haven't been thought of yet
			* To abstract/hide implementation details from the user

		* A _class_ is a *description of a data object*, and can be defined using `setClass()` in the methods package.
		* An _object_ is an instance of a class. Objects can be created using `new()`.
		* A _method_ is a function that only operates on a certain class of objects. 
		* A **_generic function_** is an R function which dispatches methods. A generic function typically encapsulates a "generic" concept, and will perform the conceptual operation, but do the right thing (call the right methods) depending on the underlying object class.

		* The most important concept is the generic/method mechanism (see slide 22 & 23 to see what a generic function is):
			* The generic function checks the class of the object
			* A search is done to see if there is an appropriate method for that class
			* If there exists a method for that class, then that method is called on the object and we're done.
			* If a method for that class does not exist, a search is done to see if there is a default method for the generic, if a defualt exists, then the default method is used.
			* If a default method doesn't exist, then an error is thrown.

		* Writing your own classes/methods! If you write new methods for new classes, chances are you will need to implement `print/show`, `summary`, `plot`. You can either write a method for a new class but for an existing generic function, or write a new generic function and new methods for those objects.
		
			* **new classes**: use `setClass`, at a minimum specify the name of the class, and often need to specify the data elements, called `slots`.
			* **new methods**: use `setMethod`, and you need to specify a generic function, and a _signature_, which is often the class you are currently developing.
			* See slide 27, 29, 31 for an illustration.

#### Introduction to Linux: Basic Shell Scripting

* Scripts are a sequence of statements and commands stored in a file that can be executed by a shell. The most commonly used shell in Linux is bash.
* Command substitution allows you to substitute the result of a command as a portion of another command.
* Functions or routines are a group of commands that are used for execution.
* Environmental variables are quantities either pre-assigned by the shell or defined and modified by the user.
* To make environment variables visible to child processes, they need to be exported.
* Scripts can behave differently based on the parameters (values) passed to them (control flow).
* The process of writing the output to a file is called output redirection.
* The process of reading input from a file is called input redirection.
* The if statement is used to select an action based on a condition.
* Arithmetic expressions consist of numbers and arithmetic operators, such as +, -, and *.

#### For this week
I missed the DR notes from 10/14 - 10/16.

* 10/14: How to start a startup: Lecture 7
* 10/15: Growth EM dinner, so didn't work on DR
* 10/16: Berkeley IEOR dinner, finished how to start a startup: Lecture 8 + Finished "Doing Data Science" Chapter 6.
