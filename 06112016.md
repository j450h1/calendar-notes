### A Quick Literature Survey on Causal Impact Analysis Using Bayesian Structural Time Series Model

* **[ARIMA]**: Classical Techniques in Timeseries (which I have very little exposure to). Key concepts include:
    * [Stationarity and Differencing]
    * [Backshift Operator]
    * [Autoregressive Models]
    * [Moving Average Models]

    It might be a good idea to go over these techniques before jumping into Bayesian methods.

* **[Sorry ARIMA, but I am going Bayesian]**: An outstanding post by Kim Larsen from Stitchfix, explaining why Bayesian Structural Time Series Model (`BSTS`) is the new default for time series analysis. In his words: 

    _When people think of “data science” they probably think of algorithms that scan large datasets to predict a customer’s next move or interpret unstructured text. But what about models that utilize small, time-stamped datasets to forecast dry metrics such as demand and sales? Yes, I’m talking about good old time series analysis, an ancient discipline that hasn’t received the cool “data science” rebranding enjoyed by many other areas of analytics._

    Unlike ARIMA, this model is more transparent because its representation does not rely on differencing, lags and moving averages.

    * You can visually inspect the underlying components of the model:
        * Trend
        * Seasonality
        * Regression component(?)
    * It handles uncertainty in a better way because you can quantify the posterior uncertainty of the individual components (beause it runs MCMC simulations in the background, so you can compute the credible intervals for each individual components)
    * One can impose prior beliefs on the model to specify which covariates should play a more important role.

* **[Inferring Causal Impact Using Bayesian Structural Time-Series Models]**: This is a R package developed at Google that leverage `BSTS` to do counterfactual (causal) impact analysis. The canonical example is the following:

    _An important problem in econometrics and marketing is to infer the causal impact that a designed market intervention has exerted on an outcome metric over time. In order to allocate a given budget optimally, for example, an advertiser must assess to what extent different campaigns have contributed to an incremental lift in web searches, product installs, or sales. This paper proposes to infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market response that would have occurred had no intervention taken place_

    There is a detailed illustrative example from the R package itself:

    Assumptions involved in this technique:

    _As with all non-experimental approaches to causal inference, valid conclusions require strong assumptions. In the case of CausalImpact, we assume that there is **a set control time series that were themselves not affected by the intervention**. If they were, we might falsely under- or overestimate the true effect. Or we might falsely conclude that there was an effect even though in reality there wasn’t. The model also assumes that the **relationship between covariates and treated time series, as established during the pre-period, remains stable** throughout the post-period_

* **[Making Causal Impact Analysis Easy]**: More broadly speaking, this article also talked about `intervention analysis`. 

    _Intervention analyses typically require more judgement than evaluation of randomized test/control studies. Specifically, when analyzing interventions through time series analysis we typically go through two steps, each of which can involve multiple analytical decisions:_

    * _Finding matching control markets for the test market where the event took place using time series matching based on historical data prior to the event (the “pre period”)._
    * _Analyzing the causal impact of the event by comparing the observed data for the test and control markets following the event (the “post period”), while factoring in differences between the markets prior to the event._

    Traditionally, matching is done by by matching on euclidean distance or correlation of timeseries, but they are somewhat problematic because euclidean distance ignore temporary shift and correlation ignored size. Analysis of causal impact traditionally using `diff in diff` approach which requires the `parallel trend` assumption that rarely work.

    One of the key assumption of the causalimpact R package is that there is a set of control time series that is not themselves affected by the intervention. One of the practical questions of using this technique then, is to choose those control markets.

    * Approach 1: When we have markets that we know did not receive the treatment (e.g. marketing campaigns were not run in those markets), we can use them as our candidates for the control time series. 
    * Approach 2: When we have many such markets, one thing that we can do is to use technique such as `dynamic time warping` to trim down the list of markets. This is what the `dtw` package do - for a given set of time series data against a target time series, it will find the subset that most closely matched with the target timeseries.
    * Approach 3: In the `casualimpact` pacakge, the `bsts` model will use spike-and-slab priors automagically to construct the control market.

    Essentially, Stitch Fix's `MarketMatching` package is a mere wrapper for the `dtw` and `casualimpact` package. In their words:

    _As mentioned above, the purpose of the dynamic time warping step is to create a list of viable control market candidates. This is not a strictly necessary step as we can select markets directly while building the time series model during step 2. In fact, the CausalImpact package selects the most predictive markets for the structural time series model using spike-and-slab priors (for more information, see the technical details below as well as [1]). However, when dealing with a large set of candidate control markets it is often prudent to trim the list of markets in advance as opposed to relying solely on the variable selection process._
