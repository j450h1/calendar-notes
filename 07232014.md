### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "Exploratory Data Analysis"

* **Week 1**:
	* [**Principles of Analytics Graphics**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/Principles.pdf):
		* Principle 1: Show comparison
			* Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis
			* Always ask "compare to what?"
		* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
			* What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
		* Principle 3: Show multivariate data
		* Integration of evidence
			* completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
			* data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
			* Don't let the tool drive the analysis
		* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc
			* A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
		* Principle 6: Content is king
			* Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
	
	* [**Exploratory Graphs I && II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/exploratoryGraphs.pdf)
		* Goal of EDA: To understand data properties, to find patterns in data, to suggest modeling strategies, to "debug" analyses
		* They are made quickly, aexes/labels are ignored, mainly for personal understanding
		* Simple summaries of data: five number summary, boxplots, histograms, density plot, barplot
		* two dimensional: multiple 1-D plots, scatterplots, smooth scatterplots
		* More than 2 dimension: overlayed 2-D plots. Use color, size, shape
	
	* [**Plot Systems in R**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/PlottingSystems.pdf)
		* **The base plotting sysmte**:
			* 'Artist's palette': start with blank canvas and build up from there. Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
		* **The lattice system**:
			* Plots are created with a single function call. Most useful for conditioning types of plot: Looking at how y changes with x across z. Good for putting many many plots on a screen
		* **ggplot2**:
			* A mixed of base and lattice

	* [**The Base Plotting System in R**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/PlottingBase.pdf)
		* For base plotting, there is a two step process:
			* initializing a new plot on a 'graphic device'
			* Annotating (adding to) an existing plot
		* keep in mind the parameters: pch (plotting character), lty (line type), lwd (line width), col (color), xlab, ylab
		* Some other base graphics parameters: _par()_ is used to specify global graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R session. _las, bg, mar, oma, mfrow, mfcol_
		* Base plotting functions: _plot, lines, points, text, title, mtext, axis_

	* [**Graphics Devices in R**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/GraphicsDevices.pdf)
		* When making a plot, the plot will show up on a 'graphic device'.There are generally two types 'graphic device':
			* screen device: this is your screen. All 3 plotting systems default to printing on your screen (quartz() on mac, windows() on window, and x11() on unix/linux)
			* file device: when you need to store the plot in a document (need the dev.off() in the end to close the plotting)
				* pdf, svg, win.metafile, postscript
				* png, jpeg, tiff, bmp
		* calling graphics device:
			* currently active graphics can be found by calling _dev.cur()_
			* _dev.set(integer)_ will set the active device
