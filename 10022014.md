#### Stanford CS 183B: How to start a start-up

Today's guest speaker is the founder of HomeJoy, Adora Cheung, who is a YC alumna. Topic is about building product, talking to users, and growing, I think the article [From Failure to $37M in Funding with Adora Chueng] summarizes her experience very well.

#### Random materails from datatau

* [How to engineer features and how to get good at it]: This is a good introduction to feature engineering, particularly the 'sub-problems of feature engineering'
	* Feature importance: an estimte of the usefulness of a feature
	* Feature extraction: the automatic construction of new features from raw data
	* Feature selection: from many features to a few that are useful
	* Feature construction: the manual construction of new features from raw data
	* Feature learning: deep learning?

	* Iterative processing of feature engineering

	* General example of feature engineering:
		* decompose categorical attributes
		* decompose a date-time
		* reframe numerical quantities

	* Some great examples of feature engineering from Kaggle. Learn from the masters (they are require to do a write-up)
		* [Predicting student test performance in KDD cup 2010]
		* [Predicting Patient Admittance in the Heritage Health Prize]

* Some random articles on [Data Science and Start-ups]: One thing I resonant a lot is the following point:
	* One of the key factors either way is the mentorship—a great PhD with a great advisor is hard to beat in terms of skill set, critical thinking, and independence; these also can be developed in an industry position with a great mentor. On the other hand, you are unlikely to gain great skills if you go straight from a master’s degree to leading a data science project. Data science is a craft, and, as with most complex crafts, one learns best by working with top-notch, experienced practitioners. 


** [Ipython notebook release]: Seems like super interesting to learn python, all the codes are available on github. I haven't had a chance to look at them yet.
