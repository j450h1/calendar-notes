### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [Coursera: Experimentation for Improvement](https://www.coursera.org/course/experiments): From the course description: _"In this course we will learn to use efficient factorial experiments, fractional factorials and response suface methods"_. I don't know what any of these are yet, but it seems like this is the first Coursera course that touch on experimentation, and it teaches the materials using R (a plus). I will keep an eye on this, and see if this class is worth it. So far, I have finished videos from the first two weeks.

	* **Week 1** (No slides)
		* Outcome|response: What will happen as a result of the experiment, outcomes can be quantitative or qualitative
		* Factors|variable: Things you can change to influence outcome, can be either continuous or categorical
		* Usually, the goal of the experiment = outcome + "desire to adjust the outcome" = objective.
		* Cube plot: When you have a two factor experiment (2 varaibles to adjust, each with 2 levels), we can draw a cube plot and plot the 4 outcomes (for each of the 4 combinations) in each corner. Check out the "How not to run an experiment" section: The basic idea is that we should run all 4 combinations, so we can compare the marginal impact of each variable!

	* **Week 2** (no slides)
		* **Two factor experiment**:
			* Advice: Make sure to randomize the order of execution for the experiment. Don't run them in the order that factors are designed
			* It teaches how to draw cube plot, contour plot, and interaction plot. All discussions are limited to 2 factors, each with 2 levels.
			* It also talked about how to estimate the coefficients of the main effects
		* **Two factor experiment with interaction**:
			* Def: Interaction : The effect of one factor (for example, A) depends on the value (or the level) of another factor B, for example.
			* Interaction is symmetric
			* In the lecture, he talked about how to calculate the coefficient for an interaction term. Interaction is mathematically defined as the "half of the difference".
		* **Three factor experiments**: very similar to two factor, but the by hand calculation quickly gets ugly. Next week, he will start to discuss how to do these coefficient calculation using R. I am suspecting that a lot of these seemingly magical estimation are just based on MLEs, but I haven't checked.
