#### Adam Kinney's Exit Talk

Some advice for junior data scientists (speaking from someone who mostly focus on insight during his career and whose stakeholders are mostly executives and decision makers):

* **The three fundamental skills**:
	* The ability to decompose an open ended question into manageable chunks. The art of problem decomposition. This comes with experience, usually harder to learn when you are freshly out from school. 
	* The basic skills of statistics, machine learning, and programming
	* The ability to distill findings into insights that are digestable
		* Go to insight and the main takeaways very soon
		* Don't have a huge climatic ending, it never works
		* Don't bother going through the narrative of what you have done for the analysis
		* When you don't know the answer, tell me here are the things that we know, and we can explore what's possible to shorten the knowledge gap. Don't over commit.


* **Nathan's question**: Often time you want to do more machine learning or more advanced statistics, but most of the time the questions are about data pull or simple aggregation. How do you balance this? We also often assume that the way to improve yourself is to be technicially competent, but your comments seem to suggest otherwise, how do you balance this?

	**Adam's answer:** When I first graduated from school, I thought the value I can bring to the table is my advanced skills in statistics. However, the reality is, most of the business questions can be answered with simple techniques and common sense, and occasionally you brings out the big guns. Therefore, I believe having that mindset is the wrong way to approach it. The value that we bring is mostly the analytics mindset, the problem decomposition, and insight generation that we can bring to the table. In the end of the day, if you do practical, rigorous work, nobody is going to care what techniques you used.


	**My take on this**: I understand where he is coming from, but I am not entirely sure he gave the complete picture. I think currently in the industry, the people who are employing sophisticated methods, are also people who have very strong engineering skills. So if you really want to do it, you can try to take the type B data scientist route, but then the prerequisite is different. For type A data scientist who are interested in type B work, we are trapped because our engineering skills are limited, so so are our opportunities. 

* When he first joined, the analytics team was more like the data platform team. 
	* It's interesting, because it makes me wonder if you are a type A data scientist, maybe you can't really provide that much value until the tools are in place. Maybe being a type B data scientist or a data engineer is more valuable in a start-up environment?

* There are still a lot of opportunities (unexplored territories) within the company. If you do a great job, you can become the go to person in that domain.


#### How to start a startup: How to be a great founder

Here are the great notes:

* [Lecture note](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lecture_attachments/FMqXkgfXRF68oPqz7jDg_How%20to%20Be%20a%20Great%20Founder.pdf). Here are the basic traits one can develop:

* [Medium Post](https://medium.com/how-to-start-a-startup/26-quotes-reid-hoffman-on-how-to-be-a-great-founder-ff99c713a199)

	* "reality is: a founder is someone who deals with a ton of different headaches and no one is universally super powered.”
	* “Part of the entrepreneurial thing is there are lots of ways to die.”
	* “What great founders do is seek the networks that will be essential to their problem and their task.”
	* “The metaphor that I frequently use for entrepreneurship is jumping off a cliff and assembling an airplane plane on the way down.”
	* “It’s very conventional to say that you’re a contrarian these days.”
	* “It’s actually pretty easy to be contrarian. It’s hard to be contrarian and right.”
	* “When you think about being contrarian, you have to think about — how is it that smart people will disagree with me, disagree with me from a position of intelligence, and there is something that I know that they don’t know, that will actually in fact play out to be true.”
	* “This is classic when you begin thinking about what is a great founder is, you navigate what is apparent paradoxes.”
	* “You gotta be both flexible and persistent.”
	* “You should have an investment thesis that essentially says why you think this is potentially a good idea.”
	* “Part of what being a great founder is, is being both able to hold the belief, to think about what it is you want to be doing and where you want to be going, but also be smart enough that you’re essentially listening to criticism, negative feedback, competitive entries.”
	* “Data only exists within the framework of a vision you’re building to, a hypothesis of where you’re moving to.”
	* “So usually you have to have product distribution as more fundamental than what the actual product is.”
	* “When I’m raising money, this fundraising, I’m thinking about the next fundraising. I’m thinking how I’m set up for it.”
	* "It’s useful to be able to recognize whether you’re on track or not. To have that belief, but also paranoia about am I tracking against my investment thesis.”
	* “The question is: how you cross uneven ground, how you assemble networks around you.”
	* “There’s an ability to learn & adapt, an ability to constantly have a vision that’s driving you, but to be taking input from all sources.”
	( “The challenge when you think about product distribution is: how are you competing for potential customers or potential members time”
	* “One of the tests that I frequently use in an interaction is I push on the idea and what I’m looking for is both flexibility & persistence.”
	* “One of the phrases I frequently look for is infinite learning curve. Because each entrepreneurial pattern is to some degree unique and new.”
	* “I am most heartened when I’m talking to a team when they’re reasoning to each other.”
	* “In software, speed to market, speed to learning is really key. In hardware, if you screw it up, you’re dead. So accuracy really matters.”
	* “If I ever hear a founder talk about oh this is how I have a balanced life so on and so forth — they’re not committed to winning.”
