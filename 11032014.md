#### Doing Data Science

Today I studied chapater 10 of DDS, the two main topics are:

* Social Network Analysis: the main ideas:
	* Basic terminologies (e.g. nodes, edges, bi-partitite graph, dyaid, triangle...etc)
	* Centrality Measures. In particular, centrality measure using principal eigenvector. I read [Justification and Application of Eigenvector Centrality], which gave me a little more intuition what this is.
	* Model based graphs -- think of graph as a realization of an underlying stochastic process or probability distribution.
	* With the probability model in place, we can do inference to figure parameters of the underlying probability model that generated the graph.

* Data Journalism: It talks very little about this topic, I don't think I actually learn anything here.
