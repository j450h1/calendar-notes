### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "Getting and Cleaning Data"

* **(Week 4) Editing Text Variables**: [slide](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/lecture_slides/04_01_editingTextVariables.pdf)
	* **toupper(), tolower(), strsplit()**
	* **sub() & gsub()**: sub() only replace one instance, gsub replace all instances in that string
	* **grep() & grepl()**: 
		*grep("Alameda", county)* will give us the indices for reocrd where country = alameda
		*grep("Alameda", country, value = TRUE)* gives the actual values instead of the indices
		*grepl("Alameda", country)* returns a vector of TRUE/FALSE
	* **library(stringr)**: is very handy. Function such as nchar, substr, paste, paste0 (no space), and str_trim
	* **Variable names should be**:
		* All lower case when possible
		* Descriptive (Diagnosis v.s. Dx)
		* Not duplicated
		* Not have underscores, dots, or white spaces

* **(Week 4) Regular Experssion I/II: (slide1)[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/lecture_slides/04_02_regularExpressions.pdf] & [slide2](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/lecture_slides/04_03_regularExpressionsII.pdf)
	* Regular Expression can be thought of as a combination of *literals* and *metacharacters*
		* Literals form the words of the language
		* Metacharacters define the grammar

	* Metacharacters:
		* **^Begin**: express the beginning of a sentence
		* **end$**: express the end of a sentence
		* **[]**: represent a character class. can also use [^char1char2...], this means include everything but char1 and char2 in the character class
		* **|**: translate to OR, and we can include any number of alternatives. e.g. alt1 | alt2 | .... | alt10
		* **()**: subexpressions are often contained in parentheses to constrain the alternative. e.g. ^([Gg]ood)|[Bb]ad). () can also be used to 'remember' text matched by the subexpression, and the matched subexpression can be referred by \1, \2...etc.
		* **?**: the question mark indicates that the indicated expression is optional
		* **.**: refers to any character
		* ** * **: means 'any number, including none, of the item'
		* **+**: means at least one of the item
		* **{ and }**: referred to as interval qualifiers; this let us specify the minimum and maximum number of matches of an expression

	* If we often need to express a literal character that is a metacharacter, we need to escape them with \. e.g. (\.)
