### Notes for Today

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 13](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch13.html): There is really not much going on here.

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Appendix, Further Study](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/apa.html)
	* Book: Getting Started with D3 by Mike Dewar. I took a quick look of Amazon's review and the book's outline, it's not nearly as good as this one. I might not pursue this.
	* Websites:
		* Anything related to Mike Bostock example seems great. I copied down some examples and confirmed that things rendered well on my own browser. So I can technically just go through the examples myself.
		* github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference has detailed documentation on all the functions that I need.
		* There is also the d3 google group if I want to be up-to-date about d3's current developement
		* blog.visual.ly/creating-animations-and-transitions-with-d3-js/ -- a great tutorial on animation and transitions in d3


I haven't really decided yet what's next for D3, there is nothing obvious just yet. Keep searching!

* [Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408902453&sr=8-1&keywords=doing+data+science)
	* I have been following the [**columbia data science class**](http://columbiadatascience.com/) and Rachel Schutt.
	* The book seems to be a compilation of the class she taught at 2012 (It was taught again in 2013). There is not much code in the book, but I think it philosophically might be a good intro for me again, to look at this field with a new fresh perspective. I got the book, but haven't started reading it yet.
	* I thoguht about reading it during commute.

* [Introduction to Linux Class: Chapter 6: Command Line Operations]
	* Learn about hard and soft (symbolic) links, implication on inode numbers?
	* find
		* finding files using regular expression (? - single character, * - any character, [] - set of character)
		* find is able to run commands on the files that it lists, when used with the -exec option.
	* touch is used to set the access, change, and edit times of files as well as to create empty files.
	* The Advanced Packaging Tool (apt) package management system is used to manage installed software on Debian-based systems. You can use the Yellowdog Updater Modified (yum) open-source command-line package-management utility for RPM-compatible Linux operating systems.
