### Notes for Today

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 12](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch12.html): This chapter is about geomapping, [**codes**](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/tree/master/chapter_12) here. Specifically, we learn:

	* **GeoJSON, a specific case of JSON files**:
		
		* GeoJSON is the JSON-based standard for encoding geodata for web applications.
		* In a typical GeoJSON style, we have an object type "FeatureCollection" as the key, followed by a value that is an array of "features" containing individual "feature objects". Each feature object contains type and geometry, under geometry we have specific coordinates of the path. 
		* The convention is that longitude first, latitude second.
		* In case your cartographic skill are a bit rusty, here is how we remember which is which:
			* Latitude is fatitude, so they wrap around the earth's waist, so it's horizontal.
			* Longtitude is long, so they are vertical.

	* **Paths**: 
		
		* Using _d3.geo.path()_ to construct SVG _path generator_. It does all the dirty work of translating that mess of GeoJSON coordinates into even messier messes of SVG path codes.
		* _svg.selectAll("path").data(json.features).enter().append("path").attr("d", path)_ where _d_ is the path data attribute, and it refers to our path generator.

	* **Projection**:

		* Real world is 3d, projection help us to project 3d coordinates into a nice 2d space.
		* D3 has several built-in projection methods, 
		* Once you define the projection, make sure to reference it in d3.geo.path as _var path = d3.geo.path().projection(projection);_.
		* We can also shrink or expand projection using _.scale(1000)_. Default is 1000 px.

	* **Choropleth**:
		
		* Def: Choropleth are geomap with areas filled in with different values (light or dark) or colors to reflect associated data values. A classic example of election map "red state, blue state".
		* They are super-useful, bu have some inherent perceptual limitations. Because it uses _area_ to encode values, large areas with low density (e.g. Nevada) might be overrepresented visually, vice versa -- A standard choropleth does not represent per-capita values fairly.

		* d3.scale.quantize: act like a linear scale, but it outputs values from within a discrete range. These output values are often numbers or colors. This is useful for sorting values into "buckets".
		* The conventional way of reading GeoJSON is using _d3.json("filename", callback_function())_. If you don't remember this convention, read ["Handling Data Loading Errors"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch05.html#_data).
		* Remember this call is _asynchronous_, meaning it won't prevent the rest of your code from running while the browser waits for that external file to load. So be aware of calling this external data somewhere else (it might not have been loaded).
		* In fact, d3.csv and d3.json can be use together in nested fashion. In this particular example, we use this nested construct to **join** datasets together:
			* Recall how we delay calling domain on the d3.scale.quantize until we have the data loaded in the callback function! Reinforce the concept that callbacks are asynchronous.
		* With this joined data, we can map data to visual elements as usual. (color-code state by agriculture productivity) 
		* The "adding points" section follows the same code pattern:
			* We first load in the data using d3.json or d3.csv
			* Once the data is loaded in the callback, we map data to visual elements (map population size with the radius of the circles).
		
	* **Acquring and Parsing Geodata**: I didn't really follow every single step in this section since it requires installing some command line tools (lazy). The basic steps involves:
		* Finding shapefiles (he pointed out several resources)
		* Choose a resolution that you think it's appropriate
		* Sometimes we want to simplify the shapes by choosing a worse resolution, remember, we don't want to load too big of data into the browser because the rendering time might increase.
		* Convert it into GeoJSON
		* With the GeoJSON file at hand, you can do all the things we learn in earlier section to visualize!
