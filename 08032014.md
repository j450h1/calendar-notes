### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 9](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch09.html):
	
	* I do not intend to finish the whole chapter 9 today. This is perhaps one of the most important chapters in this book, so I want to take it slowly. Today, I will just focus on everything up and until 'update' (inclusive).

	* The first section, **"Modernizing the Bar Chart"** is a great opportunity to apply the concept of **scales** again, so we reinforce the practice of writing flexible codes, that our chart elements resize to accommodate different sized datasets (shorter/longer arrays) and different data values (smaller/larger number). Compare the modernized/not-modernized version to see the contrast. Concepts introduced here:

		* **d3.scale.ordinal**:
			* Ordinal sclaes are typically used for ordinal data, thypically categories with some inherent _order_ to them.
			* We don't have true ordinal data for bar chart. Instead, we just want the bars to be drawn from left to right using the same order in which values occur in our dataset.
			* When we have many visual elements (e.g. vertical bars) that are positioned in an arbitrary order (left to right), but must be evenly spaced, ordinal scale is very handy.

		* _.domain(d3.range(dataset.length))_
			* Typically, when we have factor variable, we specify an array with the category names in domain (e.g. _.domain(["freshman", "sophomore", "junior", "senior"])_). For our bar chart, we simply specify the positions of each vertical bar, using the _d3.range(10)_ construct. so we really ended up _.domain([id_0, id_1, ...etc])_.

		* _.rangeBands([0, w], 0.05)_
			* This says "calculate even bands starting at 0 and ending at w, then set this scale's range to those bands", or _(w - 0) / xScale.domain().length_
			* The second parameter includes a bit of spacing between each band. In this example, it means 5% of the width of each band will be used for spacing in between bands.
			* You can also use _.rangeRoundBands_, which is the same as rangeBands(), except that the output values are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, so 12.3456 bcomes just 12.

		* Once the scale is created, you can call it by _xScale(i)_ for calling the position for item i, and _xScale.rangeBand()_ to get the width.

	* **Updating Data**

		* Introduce the concept of an **event listener**:
			* An event listener is an anonymous function that listens for a specific event on a specific DOM element or elements. When the event happens, the anonymous function will be executed to respond to that event. See an example of how updating is done via event listener. 

			* In this specific example, we update the data once the paragraph is clicked upon. So all the updating code is done in the anonymous function of that event listener.
