### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 9](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch09.html):
	
	* I do not intend to finish the whole chapter 9 today. This is perhaps one of the most important chapters in this book, so I want to take it slowly. Today, I will just focus on everything up and until 'update' (inclusive).

	* The first section, **"Modernizing the Bar Chart"** is a great opportunity to apply the concept of **scales** again, so we reinforce the practice of writing flexible codes, that our chart elements resize to accommodate different sized datasets (shorter/longer arrays) and different data values (smaller/larger number). Compare the modernized/not-modernized version to see the contrast. Concepts introduced here:

		* **d3.scale.ordinal**:
			* Ordinal sclaes are typically used for ordinal data, categories with some inherent _order_ to them.
			* We don't have true ordinal data for bar chart. Instead, we just want the bars to be drawn from left to right using the same order in which values occur in our dataset.
			* When we have many visual elements (e.g. vertical bars) that are positioned in an arbitrary order (left to right), but must be evenly spaced, ordinal scale is very handy.

		* _.domain(d3.range(dataset.length))_
			* Typically, when we have factor variable, we specify an array with the category names in domain (e.g. _.domain(["freshman", "sophomore", "junior", "senior"])_). For our bar chart, we simply specify the positions of each vertical bar, using the _d3.range(10)_ construct. so we really ended up _.domain([id_0, id_1, ...etc])_.

		* _.rangeBands([0, w], 0.05)_
			* This says "calculate even bands starting at 0 and ending at w, then set this scale's range to those bands", or _(w - 0) / xScale.domain().length_
			* The second parameter includes a bit of spacing between each band. In this example, it means 5% of the width of each band will be used for spacing in between bands.
			* You can also use _.rangeRoundBands_, which is the same as rangeBands(), except that the output values are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, so 12.3456 bcomes just 12.

		* Once the scale is created, you can call it by _xScale(i)_ for calling the position for item i, and _xScale.rangeBand()_ to get the width.

	* **Updating Data**

		* Introduce the concept of an **event listener**:
			* An event listener is an anonymous function that listens for a specific event on a specific DOM element or elements. When the event happens, the anonymous function will be executed to respond to that event. See an example of how updating is done via event listener. 

			* In this specific example, we update the data once the paragraph is clicked upon. So all the updating code is done in the anonymous function of that event listener.


* [Coursera: Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning):

	* Metaphors provide powerful techniques for learning

	* Focused and diffuse modes (pin-ball analogy)
		* Focus: tight spacing for the rubber bumper, helps to keep your thoughts concentrated. Focus on pre-frontal lope. Follows familiar neural pattern.
		* Diffuse: more widely spacing for new idea. More closely align with the resting mode of the brain. Go for a walk, take a shower, drift to sleep helps to access this mode.
			* The story of Dali and Edison. Hold on to a key/barble, and as they wander around their thoughts, the key/barble dropped, and they re-focus their energy.

	* It often takes time to build neural pathway of a new learning.
		* Pomodoro technique: Brief 25 minutes of focus concentration, follow by 5 minutes of mental relaxation
		* Tackling procrastination: You procrastinate because you don't like the feeling when you need to do something. But research has found that the unease goes away quite quickly as you dive in to the work. Maybe setting up a reward toward the end is a good way.
		* Practice and repeition is important to strengthen the neural path of new learning

	* Working memory & Long Term memory:
		* Working memory: transient, your brain only holds 4 group of thoughts at once
		* Long term memory: like a warehouse where you can access the distributed memory of the fundamental techniques of what you do
		* The key to transform working memory into long term memory is through repetition. You can't build muscles by lifting weight in just one day. There's no time for solid structure to grow.

	* The importance of sleep:
		* Sleep actually flush out poison in the brain. If you think about learnign before you go to sleep, you have a higher chance of dreaming about it, and enhancing that neural pathway.
		* Exercise is also important, and research has shown that it also has that advantage of enhancing that neural pathway.
