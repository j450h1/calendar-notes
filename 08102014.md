### Notes for Today

## Coursera: Learning how to learn class

* Summary:
	* **Chunk**: are pieces of information that are bound together through use and by meaning. Think of them as neurons that compactly synthesize information. Think of it as ribbon strands
	
	* **How to develop chunk**:
		* Focus attention
		* Understanding of the basic idea
		* Practice
		* Get bigger context
		* Recall: mental retrieval of your learning. Don't just re-read the textbook, force yourself to recall, either through talking through the points, or creating organized notes from memory or understanding.
		* Learn the materials in different environments so thinking is independent of visual cues

	* **Transfer**: once you have the underpinning of the neuron pathways of chunks, you can use them in other areas. This is related to the _when_ to use a technique than _how_.

	* **Interleaving**: practice different concepts, approaches, and techniques in one session. This would make your particular session more difficult, but you will learn deeper. Learn not just the _how_, but also the _when_.

	* **Illusion of competence**:
		* Test your self: Recall is one form of mini-testing
		* Minimize highlighting: because you might mistakenly think you already locked down the materials
		* Mistakes are good: It tells you where you are lacking, so yo u can bit by bit reinforce what you don't know
		* Deliberate Practice: don't just repeatedly spend time on things you already know. Focus on harder things you don't have good understanding

	* **Einstellung**: Your already developed pattern prevents you from be flexible an finding a solution that is somewhere else.

	* **Law of Serendipity**: Lady luck favors the one who tries
