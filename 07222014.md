* **week 3**:
	* **Analyzing a two-factor example with R**:
		* For the 4 cases in a two-factor experiment, we can solve a 4 by 4 linear equation. You can actually use lm in R to solve the 4 by 4 linear equation.
	* **Analyzing a three-factor example with R**:
		* It's basically the same as the previous, but two things worth noting:
			* create _A = B = C = c(1,-1)_, then use _design = expand.grid(A = A, B = B, c = C) to get the design matrix, then _A = design$A_ to get the column
			* To solve the systems of equations, running _lm(y ~ A + B + C + A*B + A*C + B*C + A*B*C)_ is the same as lm(y ~ (A+B+C)^3)
		* He also talked about the pareto plot (custom function using ggplot2). It's straightforward, it simply prints the coefficients in order based on their absolute values, and colorcode the + from the -.
	* **Analyzing a 4-factor example with R** is very similar to the previous sections.
