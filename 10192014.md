#### Introduction to Linux: Advanced Bash Scripting: Chapter 16

* String manipulation:
	* Get the length of a string `myLen1=${$mystring1}`
	* Get the prefix of a string `${string:0:1}`, this means we start from position `0` and continue for `1` character(s)
	* To extract all characters in a string after a dot(.), use `${string#*.}`

* case syntax
	```
	case expression in
   		pattern1) execute commands;;
   		pattern2) execute commands;;
   		pattern3) execute commands;;
   		pattern4) execute commands;;
   		* )       execute some default commands or nothing ;;
	esac
	```

* In addition to `for` and `while`, there is also the `until` construct:
	```
	until condition is false
	do
		commands for execution
		----
    done
    ```
* Shell script debugging: 
	* `set -x` #turns on debugging
	* `set +x` #turns off debugging
	* stdin, stdout, stderr corresponds to file descriptor 0, 1, 2

* Additional techniques
	* Create temp files:
		* `TEMP=$(mktemp /tmp/tempfile.XXXXXXXX)`
		* `TEMPDIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/tempdir.XXXXXXXX)`

	* Disgarding output with /dev/null: Certain commands like find will produce voluminous amounts of output which can overwhelm the console. To avoid this, we can redirect the large output to a special file (a device node) called /dev/null. e.g. `command > /dev/null`

	* Generate random numbers using `$RANDOM`
