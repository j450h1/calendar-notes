#### Coursera: Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Science

Today's lecture is actually quite good. It's not really about multivariate regression, it's more about how to deal with (and be aware of) the intricacies when your predictors (e.g. x and z) are correlated.

	* When `x -> y, x -> z & z -> y`:
		* Not a big deal, this only says that x does cause y, but through:
			* direct effect of x -> y
			* indirect effect of x -> z -> y
		* We don't really need to control for z if we want to see the total effect of x on y.

	* When `x -> y, z -> y & z -> x`:
		* This is a big deal here. z could be a confouning variable. Imagine the scenario that x truly has no causal relationship with y, but z does AND z is correlated with x. 
		* In particular, if z is unobservable and not controllable, and all we get to observe is x & y. Then we might found a spurious relationship of x & y when in fact it is just z -> y.

See the lecture videos again, I like how he lay out the math.

#### Doing Data Science

The financial modeling part covered by Cathy is a bit confusing for me. There is no good notes (yet). TBC

#### Coursera: Developing Data Product

* Manipulate: super light-weight but easy to use when you need to share the chart with another DS who is using R studio
* rCharts: one of the best package to create javascript based interactive visualization
* googlevis: Leverage google's graph API
