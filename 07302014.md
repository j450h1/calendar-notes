### Notes for Today

## Coursera Exploratory Analysis Class
* **Week 2**:
	* [**Lattice Plotting System I & II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/PlottingLattice.pdf)

		* Lattice plotting system build on top _lattice_ and _grid_. The lattice plotting system does not have a "two phase" aspect with separate plotting and annotation like in base plotting. All plotting/annotation is done at once.

			* _xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data)_ is the most important plot in lattice plotting system.
				* we use formula notation
				* | is the conditioning on syntax
				* f * g is all combinations of levels of f and g
				* data is just the dataframe where f and g can be found

			* Comparison to Base plotting system
				* base graphics prints to graphics device, lattice grpahics function return an object of class trellis, and we can store it and plot it using the print function.
					* p <- xyplot(...); print(p) # save it and print it
					* xyplot(...) # auto printing

			* Lattice functions have a **panel function** which controls what happens inside each panel of the plot. (Example 11/15, 12/15). Essentially, panel function allows you to add additional visualization in each panel (median, or a linear regression line)

		* **Summary**:
			* lattice plots are constructed with a single function call
			* Aspects like margins and spacing are automatically handled
			* The lattice systme is ideal for conditional plot
			* panel functions can be specified to modify what is plotted in each of the plot sub-panels.

	* [**ggplot2**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata/lecture_slides/ggplot2.pdf)

		* basic: _qplot()_
			* plots are made up of **aesthetics** (size, shape, color) and **geoms** (points, lines)
			* factors are important for **indicating subsets** of the data; they should be ** properly labeled** (e.g. don't use 1,2,3, use the informative name name1, name2, name3)
			* Facets are super important, they are the engine that makes small multiples (panels)

			* **Summary of qplot()**:
				* The qplot() function is the analog to plot() but with many built-in features
				* Syntax somewhere in between base/lattice
				* Produce nice graphics, almost publication ready
				* Difficult to go against the grain/customize (don't bother, use ggplot2)

		* **The ggplot2 plotting system**:

			* Component of a plot:
				* A **data frame**
				* **aesthetic mappings**: how data are mapped to color, size
				* **geoms**: geometric objects like points, lines, shapes
				* **facets**: for conditional plots
				* **stats**: statistical transformation like binning, quantiles, smoothing
				* **scales**: what scale an aesthetic map uses
				* **coordinate system**

			* When building plots in ggplot2, the 'artist's pallette' model may be the closest analogy. Plots are built up in layers. When store ggplot into a varaible, say g, we can always do summary(g) to get information about the graphic.

				* Start building using any of the above componenets
					* Check out the **modifying labels** slide: know the difference of assigning a aesthetic to a constant variable v.s. data variable. If it's a data variable, need to wrap it around using _aes_
				* Annotation: _xlab()_, _ylab()_, _labs()_, _ggtitle()_
				* _axis limits_. Do not use _ylim(...)_ (outlier will be removed from the plot), use _coord_cartesian(ylim(...))_ so the outlier is still preserved but y-axis is zoom-in
				* Using cut to transform a continuous variable to a factor variable for conditional plotting is very useful

			* **Summary**:
				* ggplot2 is very powerful and flexible if you learn the "grammar"
				* Many more plots can be made, explore them!
