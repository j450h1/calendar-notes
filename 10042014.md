#### Conversation with Krist, Twitter's senior data visualization scientist

* To continue learning d3.js, building a dashboard at/for Twitter is probably not a great idea, because you will have to deal a lot with credential set-ups, which is not really about d3.

* To build a full fledge application, you pretty much need to know the full-stack. It's good to learn all these, but you might want to think about what to focus on, because there are only so much you can learn in a given time.

* Taking Krist himself as an example, he is essentially a front-end person, he only does the bare-minimum in the back-end so he can produce what he needs. If you really want to learn the back-end, rails, node.js, sinatra, python flask are all good options.

* If you want to focus on the front-end, lo-dash, jQuery, angular.js are all helpful. A lot of them, you don't need to talk to a database, to mimic interaction behaviors (even when they are stored on disk).

*   Check out Twitter's internal code, and use them as examples to follow. The code might not be as clean, because sometimes they are under deadline and pressures.

* His brother is currently an advisee of Jeff Heer, and Krist know him personally.

* Just take a dataset, and build d3 visualization on top of it, that's the best way to learn.

#### [Harvard CS 171: Visualization: Lab 5]

Today's lecture is about basic jQuery, the main topics are:

* Introduce jQuery -- skel1.html
* Selectors and scoped selectors and iteration -- skel1.html
* Event handling on above -- skel2.html
* The use of closures -- skel2.html
* Use jquery to scrape a web page (after inserting jQuery) -- skel3.html
* Convert that scraping code into a function, and put it in a $.ajax--skel3.html
* Bar graph using fivs and sorting, etc -- skel4.html
* Structuring your code as modules (module pattern, dictionary structure) -- skel5.html

I think codeSchool's tryJQERY class does a great job in explaining selectors, event handling. The rest of the learning are somewhat blurry.

#### iPython cookbook

I recently came across [iPython cookbook], and I found out that he essentially posted all the codes on [github], with the iPython notebooks. This means (still need to double check) all the book materials are actually are available via iPython notebook. I had to go through some hurdles before I can render the notebooks. The steps that I have to take are the following:

```
# Install virtualenv if you haven't. Once that's set up, create a new virtualenv folder
virtualenv my_python_cookbook
cd my_python_cookbook

# Git clone the python notebook repo
git clone https://github.com/ipython-books/cookbook-code.git

# Activate the virtual env dev environment
cd /bin; source activate

# Install necessary packages
pip install ipython

# This might failed, with pyzmq missing. In such case, pip install individual packages
pip install pyzmq
pip install jinja2
pip install tornado

# Finally, start the ipython notebook server
ipython notebook
```

#### Coursera: Professionalism: Week 4

Week 4 is a bit too philosophical for me, and I don't know how to practically apply these knowledges
