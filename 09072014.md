### Notes for Today

Continue to explore Harvard CS107 - Visualization Course. There are total of 6 labs, and I am going over lab 2/6 today. The instructor wasn't very good at explaining things, but there were still a few take aways that reinforce my understanding.


Namely, I get to "chunk" on how `enter()`, `exit()` and `update()` works again in d3. Here are the summary:

####First, let's take a look at a typical select, binding, enter, set attribute

* Let's examine what's being return in each step. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/select_bind_enter_setAttribute_flow.png)

	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p")` only select all paragraph DOM elements, length is 0.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6])` binds data to the elements, and the length is 6.
	* But it's not until when we enter the binded data/elements -- (`d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6]).enter()`), do we see each datum made available in the data structure.
	* It's not until we append the paragraph DOM do they really become a DOM element (notice the array changed from an array of objects to an array of p's) -- `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6]).enter().append("p")`.
	* Once we have the paragraphs, we can just directly manipulate their attributes -- `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").text(function(d) {return d*100;})`.

####Here's some illustration on entering:

* In particular, let's look at the case where there are more data points than DOM elements that are currently on the canvas. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/enter_pointer_illustration.png)

	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])`, we binded more data, but looking at the reference returned, even though it's an array of length 8, we still have just 6 p.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]).enter()`. Once we apply the enter selection, this acts like a 'SUB-SELECTION', only the ones that are left out (have data but no DOM elements) are returned. 
	* This is why, in subsequent append + text attribute manipulation, only the 7th and 8th element are affected.

####Here's some illustration on exiting:

* In particular, let's look at the cases where there are more DOM elements than data points. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/exit_pointer_illustration.png)

	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4])` -- only select the 4 existing elements, so we see 0,1,2,3.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4]).exit()` -- again, `exit()` here acts like a SUB-SELECTION, and only 5th and 6th were not binded, so they are ready to go away from the canvas.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4]).exit().text("To be removed")` the text attribute applies only to the 5th and 6th elements since that's what were referenced.

### Mike Bostock's Explanation on Update, Enter, and Exit

* [**Three little circles**](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/circles/): Short read, and it's a good recap. The most important summary is in the "All together section":
	* enter - incoming elements, entering the stage.
	* update - persistent elements, staying on stage.
	* exit - outgoing elements, exiting the stage.


By default, the data join happens by index: the first element is bound to the first datum, and so on. Thus, either the enter or exit selection will be empty, or both. If there are more data than elements, the extra data are in the enter selection. And if there are fewer data than elements, the extra elements are in the exit selection.
