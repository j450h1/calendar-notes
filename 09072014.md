### Notes for Today

Continue to explore Harvard CS107 - Visualization Course. There are total of 6 labs, and I am going over lab 2/6 today. The instructor wasn't very good at explaining things, but there were still a few take aways that reinforce my understanding.


Namely, I get to "chunk" on how `enter()`, `exit()` and `update()` works again in d3. Here are the summary:

* First, let's take a look at a typical select, binding, enter, set attribute and examine what's being return in each step. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/select_bind_enter_setAttribute_flow.png)

	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p")` only select all paragraph DOM elements, length is 0.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6])` binds data to the elements, and the length is 6.
	* But it's not until when we enter the binded data/elements -- (`d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6]).enter()`), do we see each datum made available in the data structure.
	* It's not until we append the paragraph DOM do they really become a DOM element (notice the array changed from an array of objects to an array of p's) -- `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6]).enter().append("p")`.
	* Once we have the paragraphs, we can just directly manipulate their attributes -- `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").text(function(d) {return d*100;})`.

Here's some illustration on entering:

* In particular, let's look at the case where there are more data points than DOM elements that are currently on the canvas. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/enter_pointer_illustration.png)

	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])`, we binded more data, but looking at the reference returned, even though it's an array of length 8, we still have just 5 p.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]).enter()`. Once we apply the enter selection, this acts like a 'SUB-SELECTION', only the ones that are left out (have data but no DOM elements) are return. 
	* This is why, in subsequent append + text attribute manipulation, only the 7th and 8th element are affected.

Here's some illustration on exiting:

* In particular, let's look at the cases where there are more DOM elements than data points. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/exit_pointer_illustration.png)

	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4])` -- only select the 4 existing elements, so we see 0,1,2,3.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4]).exit()` -- again, `exit()` here acts like a SUB-SELECTION, and only 5th and 6th were not binded, so they are ready to go.
	* `d3.select("body").selectAll("p").data([1,2,3,4]).exit().text("To be removed")` the text attribute applies only to the 5th and 6th elements since that's what were referenced.
