### Notes for Today

## Coursera Experiment Class:

I have a feeling that this class is going downhill. I get the conepts that was discussed here, but they seem so different from any of the statistical/Machine Learning stuff that I have learned. I am having a hard time to make real world connections of these class materials.

* **Response Surface Methods**
	
	* Achievable objectives when improving a process - based on data
		* learn more about, and increase your understanding (e.g. pareto plot)
		* troubleshoot a problem
		* make predictions
		* try to optimize thep process
		* monitor the system to ensure performance gains are retained

	* Response surface methods is about "sequential groups of experiments" to create empirical models, and to reach an optimum of a process using only factors that affect your outcome. This is typically done after you have your screened experiments.
		* By screened experiments (I think) it means that we are screening out the varaibles that affect outcome from those who don't.

	* **One variable response surface**: here are the critical concepts
		* Real-world units and coded units:
			* code value = (real value) - (center) / (0.5 * range) where center = (high) + (low) / 2 and range = high - low.
			* real value = coded value * 0.5 * range + center value

		* Linear v.s. nonlinear systems
			* demonstrate this by adding quadratic terms into the prediction equation

		* Prediction model are wrong, but still useful
			* "all models are wrong, but some are useful"
			* "..the practical question is how wrong do they have to be before they are not useful"
			* Ofthen not useful = prediction are not accurate


		* Noise and error and the need for replicated experiments
			* noise = variation in setting up experiment + error in measureing y 

		* How to systematically reach an optimum
			* make prediction
			* run experiment, to see how far the prediction is from reality
			* When needed, use the new data point and refit the model

		* Justify the choice of every experiments: the typical process is:
			* run your factorial experiment to get pareto plot and produce initial predictio model
			* cuenter point: confirm our model was linear used to check prediction quality (if a linear model is chosen)
			* exploratory first step outside the initial factorial to test the model's prediction quality. Rebuild model if needed
			* Step by step identify the optimum

	* **Why changing one step at a time (COST) might failed**:
		* the chance you hitting the optimum gets lower as you increase the number of variables + if there are interactions and other unusual surface shapes
		* leads you into a false belief that you have reached the optimum
		* We will learn how to run RSM in more dimensions, and answer questions such as:
			* Which direction shoudl we climb up that mountain?
			* How do wew get to the top quickly?
			* What step size should we take?
			* What if the surface is non-linear?
			* When do we stop?
