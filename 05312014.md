### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-         introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/): Finished lecture 3 and 4.
 
     * **Lecture 3**: This lecture covers the use of iteration to build programs whose execution time depends upon the size of inputs. It also introduces      search problems and brute force and bisection for solving them.
     * **Lecture 4**: This lecture introduces the notion of decomposition and abstraction by specification. It also covers Python modules, functions,          parameters, and scoping. Finally, it uses the Python assert statement and type 'str'.

I still think the lectures are a bit slow, I will keep watching a few lectures (since each one only takes half an hour) to evalulate this class.
