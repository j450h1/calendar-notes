### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-         introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/): Finished lecture 3 and 4.
 
     * **Lecture 3**: This lecture covers the use of iteration to build programs whose execution time depends upon the size of inputs. It also introduces      search problems and brute force and bisection for solving them.
     * **Lecture 4**: This lecture introduces the notion of decomposition and abstraction by specification. It also covers Python modules, functions,          parameters, and scoping. Finally, it uses the Python assert statement and type 'str'.

I still think the lectures are a bit slow, I will keep watching a few lectures (since each one only takes half an hour) to evalulate this class.

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html): Finished Chapter 3 (Technology Fundamentals) and Chapter 4 (Setup).

	* **Chapter 3: Technology Fundamentals**: I love this chapter. Here are the basic ideas:

		* **The web**: Cover the concept of conversations between Server (either remote or localhost) and Client (often Browsers). The client requests for information, the server return with response. 

		* **URL**: Protocol + URI + port + subpages

		* **HTML**:
			* **Content + Structure**: Like Markdown is used for visual structure, HTML is used to specify semantic structure (attaching hierarchy, relationships, and meaning to the contents)
			* **Adding structure with elements + common element**: html, head (where css, .js, script are placed), title, body, h1/2/3/4, p, ul, ol, li...etc.
			* **Attributes, classes, and IDs** (only unique in a single page)
			* **DOM**: Document Object Model refers to the hierarchical structure of HTML. After the client receives the HTML raw text, we will need to translate it into a DOM.
			* **Developer Tool**: Mainly focus on Google chrome (Command + Option + I)
			* **Rendering**: the process by which browsers, after parsing HTML and generating DOM, apply visual rules to the DOM content.

				* **CSS**: the concept of selectors -> properties and values. Call cascading because enforcement is done in cascading style (top-bottom), but really it's driven by specificity (i.e. how specific the rule is)
				* **How to use CSS on HTML**:
					* Embedded CSS in your HTML
					* Reference an external stylesheet from HTML
					* Attach inline styles (not recommended)
				* Inheritance, Cascading, and Specificity

		* **Javascript**:

			* Variable, arrays, and javascript objects
			* JSON, which is a specific type of javascript object
			* Mathematical operations, comparison operators
			* Control structure 
			* Functions

			* Referencing Scripts
				* Include directly in HTML
				* Reference in a separate .js file

			* Javascript Gotchas!
				* Dynamic typing. Javascript is not a strongly typed language like Java
				* Variable hoisting (don't really get this)
				* Function level-scope
				* Global namespace
		
		* **SVG**:
			* The SVG element
			* Styling SVG element in CSS
			* Layering and drawing orders
			* Transparancy
	
	*  **Chapter 4**: I also successfully setup the environment. The steps are simple
		* mkdir d3-project-folder
		* mkdir d3-project-folder/d3
		* touch d3-project-folder/index.html
		* git clone d3 repo and place d3.js in d3-project-folder
		* In d3-project-folder, at command line, type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &.

## Coursera Data Science Series: "Getting and Cleaning Data"

* **(Week 1) data.table package** : Review the video & [slides](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/lecture_slides/01_09_dataTable.pdf) again
	* Subsetting in rows are basically the same as data.frame, the interesting part is subsetting by columns, very different!
	* We can apply "expressions" directly with the usual column subsetting to enrich rich operations
	* Adding columns; Multiple operations; plyr like operations, Special variable .N;
	* Making deep copies v.s. creating pointers (be careful what you want)
	* keys; join;
	* fast reading 

* **Summarizing Data**:
	* cross tab using *xtabs* or *ftable*
	* size of the data set using *object.size* or *print(object.size(fakeData), units = "Mb")*

* **Creating new variables**:
	* Easier cutting: *library(Hmisc); restData$zipGroups = cut2(restData$zipCode, g=4)*
	* Using Mutate function to add a new column (it's like cbind)

* **Reshaping Data**:
	* **melt**: *library(reshape2); carMelt = melt(mtcars, id=c("carname","gear","cyl"), measure.vars=c("mpg", "hp"))*. we usually ended up enumerating all combination of "carname", "gear", "cyl", and variable column has "mpg"|"hp", and value is the actual value. 
	* **dcast**: *dcast(carMelt, cyl ~ variable); cyl will be the row, variable will be the columns, and default is the frequency of occurences. dcast(carMelt, cyl ~ variable, mean) will calculate the mean for each (cyl,variable) combination.
	* **tapply**: *tapply(variable to act on, variable to split by, FUN)*. Performing FUN on variable to act on by variable to split by.
	* **split**: split breaks varaible to act on by variable to split by, and put them into a list.
	* **lapply**: often used together with split, lapply applies through a list. 
	* **ddply**: the split + lapply combination can easily be done using ddply (You use this all the time!).

* **Merge Data**:
	* **merge**: *merge(x, y, by, by.x, by.y, all)*. Handy because the join-key for x and y don't have to have the same name. The default is join x and y on all common column names.
	* **join in plyr**: Alternatively, we can use join in plyr, faster, but is limited to only keys that have the same name. Not good if the join key are named differently on x and y.
	* For multiple data sets, use **join_all**.
