### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-         introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/): Finished lecture 3 and 4.
 
     * **Lecture 3**: This lecture covers the use of iteration to build programs whose execution time depends upon the size of inputs. It also introduces      search problems and brute force and bisection for solving them.
     * **Lecture 4**: This lecture introduces the notion of decomposition and abstraction by specification. It also covers Python modules, functions,          parameters, and scoping. Finally, it uses the Python assert statement and type 'str'.

I still think the lectures are a bit slow, I will keep watching a few lectures (since each one only takes half an hour) to evalulate this class.

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html): Finished Chapter 3 (Technology Fundamentals) and Chapter 4 (Setup).

	* **Chapter 3: Technology Fundamentals**: I love this chapter. Here are the basic ideas:

		* **The web**: Cover the concept of conversations between Server (either remote or localhost) and Client (often Browsers). The client requests for information, the server return with response. 

		* **URL**: Protocol + URI + port + subpages

		* **HTML**:
			* **Content + Structure**: Like Markdown is used for visual structure, HTML is used to specify semantic structure (attaching hierarchy, relationships, and meaning to the contents)
			* **Adding structure with elements + common element**: html, head (where css, .js, script are placed), title, body, h1/2/3/4, p, ul, ol, li...etc.
			* **Attributes, classes, and IDs** (only unique in a single page)
			* **DOM**: Document Object Model refers to the hierarchical structure of HTML. After the client receives the HTML raw text, we will need to translate it into a DOM.
			* **Developer Tool**: Mainly focus on Google chrome (Command + Option + I)
			* **Rendering**: the process by which browsers, after parsing HTML and generating DOM, apply visual rules to the DOM content.

				* **CSS**: the concept of selectors -> properties and values. Call cascading because enforcement is done in cascading style (top-bottom), but really it's driven by specificity (i.e. how specific the rule is)
				* **How to use CSS on HTML**:
					* Embedded CSS in your HTML
					* Reference an external stylesheet from HTML
					* Attach inline styles (not recommended)
				* Inheritance, Cascading, and Specificity

		* **Javascript**:

			* Variable, arrays, and javascript objects
			* JSON, which is a specific type of javascript object
			* Mathematical operations, comparison operators
			* Control structure 
			* Functions

			* Referencing Scripts
				* Include directly in HTML
				* Reference in a separate .js file

			* Javascript Gotchas!
				* Dynamic typing. Javascript is not a strongly typed language like Java
				* Variable hoisting (don't really get this)
				* Function level-scope
				* Global namespace
		
		* **SVG**:
			* The SVG element
			* Styling SVG element in CSS
			* Layering and drawing orders
			* Transparancy
	
	*  **Chapter 4**: I also successfully setup the environment. The steps are simple
		* mkdir d3-project-folder
		* mkdir d3-project-folder/d3
		* touch d3-project-folder/index.html
		* git clone d3 repo and place d3.js in d3-project-folder
		* In d3-project-folder, at command line, type: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &.
