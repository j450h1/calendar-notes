# Introduction

Life is not an engineering problem. There is no pre-defined solution, there isn't a great deal of data. When you have a desired outcome but there is no clear solution in sight, that's where design thinking can help. You brainstorm, you try ideas and prototype. Figuring out your life is just like a design problem, and the authors believe designing thinking is the best approach to solve them.

* Dysfunctional Beliefs:
    - Your degrees determines your career
    - Reframe: 3/4 of all college grads don't end up in working in a career related to their majors

* Dysfunctional Beliefs:
    - If you are successful, you will be happy
    - Reframe: True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you

* Dysfunctional Beliefs: 
    - It's too late
    - Reframe: It's never too late to design a life you love

Here are the traits and tools of being a design thinking oriented individual:

* Be curious: Curiosity invites exploration, make everything plays, and will help you "get good at being lucky"

* Try stuff: bias to action, building your way forward. Not fixiated at one outcome, try things forward

* Reframe problems: Reframe helps you to step back, examine your biases, and explore new solution spaces

* Know it's a process: It's going to be messy, let go of the outcome, focus on what's next and the process

* Ask for help: When you ask for help, the world reaches back to you. Focus on radical collaboration. You are not alone.

Passion is over-rated, we all have multiple interests, we can all have interesting multiple lives. We need to prototype experience and move forward. There is no one single defined path, think of being a serial life entreprenuer with several careers.


# Chapter 1: Start Where You Are

* Dysfunctional Beliefs: 
    - I should already know where I'm going
    - Reframe: You can't know where you are going until you know WHERE YOU ARE

The most important first step is to know where you are, and try really hard to figure out what the problem is. Have a beginner's mindset, do not impose too many assumptions, and start learning and prototyping experience to understand more. This happens all the time - how often do we fall in love with our first solution and refuse to move on.

* The authors recommended the Health/Work/Play/Love Dashboard exercise:
    - write a few sentences about how it's going in each of the four areas
    - mark where you are (0 to full) on eage gauge
    - Ask yourslef if there's a design problem you'd like to tackle in any of these areas

It's impossible to predict the future, but once you start design something, it changes the future that is possible. So although it is not possible to know the future, or figure out a great life design before you begin, at least you have a good idea of your starting point. 

* Finally, be aware of **GRAVITY** Problems. There are two types of gravity problem, know which one you are dealing with:
    - Inactionable ones: There is nothing you can do to change this, the only solution is "acceptance".
    - Functional inactionable ones: something that is really really hard and require effort and sacrifice and runs a high risk of failure but is worth trying
