### Notes for Today

Continue the theme of this week, a lot of the learning seems to be driven by Work. We covered the basics of Vertica and the power of its analytics function. Today, I want to review some Tableau concepts. The following topics are selected as I see fit today, so they are not very well organized, nor are the concepts gaurantee to be connected.

* [Using and Refreshing Extracts]: 

	* Extracts are basically cached data, we usually use extracts for performance reason (fast loading of dashboards). To load extracts, go to the Data icon on the top left, and right click to select extracts.
	* When connecting to extracts instead of live data, extracts might not have the most up-to-date data, but we can refresh extracts or set schedules to automatically refresh extracts so it's constantly refresh itself.

* [Data Blending]

	* **Basic Blending**: It's essentially a join. We can create 'data' ->relationship' to specify which variables are related. Once linked, we can combine data from two different sources. Primary source has a blue check-mark, secondary source has a orange check-mark.

	* **Aggregate by 2nd Dimension**: Can use measures from primary data source and key from secondary data source.

	* **Blend at Lower Level**: We can blend two data on the same key (state), but then group things by another dimension that's higher level (region). [I didn't explain this well]

	* **Bullet Chart**: A bit confusing, but it compares data head to head.

	* **Map**: ok...I don't see the point here.

	* **Calculations**: Combine measures from two data sources using calculated fields.

* [Google Analytics]

	* Canonical example: viewing traffic over time and see which places users are exiting from. 'Connecting data' -> 'Google anlytics'. Then, we have to enter account/property/profile. 

* [Authoring Interactivity]
	
	* Using quick filter is the key!
	
	* When we have a higher & lower level dimensions, we can put both of them as quick filters. The lower level would change as we update the higher level quick filter.
	
	* What if we want the quick filter to work on multiple sheets on a dashboard? 'triangle' on quick filter -> 'Apply to worksheets' -> 'All using this data source'. (Very much like make global)
	
	* In Tableau 8, we can even apply that to only a subset of worksheets, not all worksheet.
	
	* **Actions**: 
		* Example: click on a state on a map, show the corresponding wiki page for that state
		* 'dashboard' -> 'Actions' -> 'add action' -> '{filter, highlight, url}'. We then specify on WHAT ACTION, what is triggered.
