#### How to Start a Start-up

* **Team**
	* Co-founders: Be very careful about finding co-founder. It's best to find someone who you have a long history with. Do not find random people.
	* If you can't find a co-founder at School. Companies like Google, Facebook are great places to find co-founders as well.
	* Co-founders > solo founder > bad co-founders
	* You need relentlessly resourceful co-founder. Tough, decisive, creative, calm, the pop culture equivalent is James Bond.

* **Hiring**:
	* Stay smaall, as long as you can. 
	* The cost of wrong early hire is very high
	* When you do end up at hiring model - hire the best people. It's not easy, and it's a long process. Make people believe you are the breakout rocket ship.
	* How much time should you spend hiring? Either 0% or 25%
	* Mediocre engineers do not build great companies. You can get away with it as a big company, but not a start-up.
	* Source of candidates -- by far, it's people you already know. FB & Google squeeze out from you all the smart people you know.
	* For start-up: we don't care about experience that much.
	* 3 questions of hiring:
		* Are they smart?
		* Do they get things done?
		* Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?
		* Good communication skills
		* Manically determined
		* Pass the animal test - everyone describe that person as an animal (e.g. she's an animal when it comes coding all night, or he's an animal when it comes closing sales.)
		* Would feel comfortable reporting to them

	* You should give 10% of the equity to the first 10 employee.
	* You should be more generous to the employee, than the investors. Don't do it backward. 
	* You've hired the best - now keep them around!
	* Let the them take the credits, you should take the hit and the responsibilities. 
	* Be aware that when you are a first manager, chances are you are going to be bad, so make sure you over-compensate.
	* Fire fast - very difficult, almost everyone waits too long. Fire people who are involved in doing bad work, office politics, and persistently negative.
	* Really great people can often find a good place in the company, if the role doesn't fit anymore. 

* **Execution**:
	* Being a founder means to sign up for years long of grind
	* Whatever the founders do shape the culture
	* A big of execution is putting in the efforts
	* The thing about start-up is even if you try really hard, and the work doesn't work. It doesn't matter
	
	* The CEO has five jobs:
		* Set the vision
		* raise money
		* evangelize the compnay
		* Hire and manage
		* Make sure the entire company executes
	
	* Focus
		* What are you spending time and money one?
		* What are teh two or three most important things?
		* Say no, a lot.
		* Set overarching goals. Repeat them
		* Communicate
		* Maintain growth and momentum
		* Work together in person (remote co-founding team slows down the cycle when communication and exchange are so important)
	
	* Intensity
		* Relentless operating rhythm
		* Obsession with execution quality
		* bias towards action. Indecisiveness is the killer of start-up
		* Quick
		* Do whatever it takes
		* SHow up
		* Don't give up
		* Be courageous
		* Get on a plane in marginal situation

	* Every time you talk to a good cofounder, they've **gotten new things done!** This is the single most predictor of a good cofounder.
	* Always keep momentum. It's the live-blood of start-up! Always keep growing. 
	* Sales fix everything(?)
	* WHen momentum sacks, people start to disagree. 

	* Set an operating rhythm
		* Shipping product
		* Launching new features
		* Reviewing/reporting metrics and milestones
	* "The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time" - Henry Ford
