### Notes for Today

## Today's session: Evalute potential new classes: "Web Application Architectures"

* **Module 2**:
	* First thing first, [**set up development environment**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/SettingUpYourDevelopmentEnvironment.pdf): This alone took a while, for some reason, I couldn't get the _gem install rails_ part to work...

	* I watched the first 3 videos of module 2. I don't want to rush through the remaining lectures.
