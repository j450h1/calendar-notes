### Notes for Today

#### Edx: Introduction to Linux

I haven't been very disciplined in taking notes, and I think the second half of the class is a lot more relevant to what I am doing. I should start documenting the specific learnings.

* [**Chapter 09: User Environment**]

	* **Startup files**: are used to configure the environment -- ranging from customizing the user's prompt, defining command-line shortcuts and aliases; setting the default editor or the $PATH for where to find executable programs.

		* When you first login to linux, `/etc/profiles` is read and evaluated, after which the following files are searched (if they exist) in the listed order:

			* `~/.bash_profile`
			* `~/.bash_login`
			* `~/.profile`

		* The linux login shell evaluates whatever startup file that it comes across first and ignores the rest.

		* Every time you create a newl shell, you do not perform a full system login: only the `~/.bashrc` file is read and evaluated. Most distributions include the `~/.bashrc` file from within one of the three user-owned startup files. In Ubuntu, the user must make appropriate changes in the `~/.bash_profile` to include the `~/.bashrc` file.

		* The `.bash_profile` will have certain extra lines, which in turn will collect the required customization parameters from `.bashrc`.

	* **Environment Variables**

		* Export a new variable value: `export VARIABLE=value`
		* Add a variable permanently: Edit the `~/.bashrc` to add `export VARIABLE=value`, then `source ~/.bashrc`

		* Some important environment variables are $HOME, $PATH, $PS1
			* $HOME: specifies the home directory (i.e. when you type ~ or cd)
			* $PATH: is an ordered list of directories which is scanned when a command is given to find the appropriate program or script to run. Each cirectory in the path is separated by :, a NULL directory indicates the current directory
			* $PS1: used to customize your prompt string. 
				* \u - username
				* \h - hostname
				* \w - current working directory
				* \d - date
			* $SHELL: the location of default command shell

	* **Execute previous commands**

		* `!!` - execute the previous command
		* `!$` - refers to the last argument in a line 
		* `!n` - refer to the nth command line
		* `!string` - refer to the most recent command starting with string
		* `CTRL-R` does reverse search

	* **File ownership**

		* Files have three kinds of permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x). These permissions affect three groups of owners: user/owner (u), group (g), and others (o).

			* Example1: `chmod uo+x, g-x my_file'
			* Example2: `chmod 755 a_file`

		* A single algorithm allows us to use 3 numbers to change the permission for each of the 3 user type.

			* 4 if read permission is desired
			* 2 if write permission is desired
			* 1 if execute permission is desired

* [**Chapter 10: Text Editor**]

	* Vim has three modes: command, insert, and line. (I don't know what the last type is)
	
	* Searching for text in vi
		* /pattern: search forward for pattern
		* ?pattern: search backward for pattern
		* n: move to next occurence of search pattern
		* N: move to previous occurences of search pattern
	
	* Working with Text in vi. Here are the ones that I don't already know:
		* a: Append text after cursor
		* i: insert text before cursor
		* I: Insert text in the beginning of the line
		* r: replace character at current position
		* R: repalce text starting with current position; stop upon escape key
		* D: delete the rest of the current line
		* H: move the cursor to the top of the screen, not the same as :0 (top of file)

#### Coursera: Professionalism

* Finished the second module. Focus on communication.

---
#### Doing Data Science

* Finish the preface + chapter 1. I just want to prepare myself to go back to some contents that are statistics & math driven. A broader question to think about is how, in my self learning path, always have a good balance of stat/math & CS.
