* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 7](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch07.html):
	
	* "Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range" -- Mike Bostock
	
	* We will introduce only the linear scale in this chapter. See the end of the chapter for more scales. Same ideas though.
	
	* The main use cases for scale of course is that you can map the values of the data to the scale of the visual pan you have, and you never had to worry about doing the math yourself to figure out the scale transformation.
	
	* With **linear scale**, all it does it normalization:
		* The input value is normalized to a number between 0 and 1, according to the domain
		* and then the normalized value is scaled to the output range.
	
	* **Creating a scale**:
		* _var scale = d3.scale.linear()
						.domain([100, 500])
						.range([10, 350])_
		* Then you can start using the scale function like _scale(100)_
	
	* *min & max* function:
		* Very handy, _d3.max(dataset, anon function)_, where the anon function is often a **accessor** to get an datum from a more complicated data structure (e.g. getting the first element of an array [x1, x2])
		* The min and max function are often used in the _.domain()_ and _.range()_ function

	* Once you have the scale function, you can start applying them in places where you input the data value. e.g. d[1] -> xScale(d[1])

	* To reverse the vertical orientation, simply replace _.range[0, h]_ with _.range([h, 0])_

	* Padding is another concern we should take care off. This chapter does it in a ad-hoc way, to learn more systematic approach, see [**Mike Bostock's margin convention**](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3019563)

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 8](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch08.html):

	* D3's axes are actually functions whose parameters you define. Unlike scales, when an axis function is called, it doesn't return a value, but generate the visual elements of the axis, including lines, labels, and ticks.

	* Setting up an Axis:
		* _var xAxis = d3.svg.axis();_
		* At a minimum, each axis also needs to be told on what scale to operate on, so _xAxis.scale(xcale);_. We can also adjust the orientation of the labels (X axis: top, bottom, Y axis: left, right)

	* Once it is set up, we append it as an SVG group element "g":
		* _svg.append("g").call(xAxis);_. because an _axis_ function actually draws something to the screen (by appending SVG elements to the DOM), we need to specify where in the DOM it should place those new elements. This is in contrast to scale functions like xScale(), for example, which calculate a value and return those values, typically for use by yet another function, without impact the DOM at all.
		
		* a g element is a _group_ element. Group elements are invisible, unlike line, rect, and circle. and they have not visual presence. Yet they help us in two ways:
			* g elements can be used to contain other elements, which keeps our code nice and tidy.
			* we can apply _transformations_ to _g_ elements, which affects how visual elements within that group are rendered.
			* To learn more about _transformations_, check out [SVG transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform). In this particular cases, we try to translate the axis from top to bottom by translating its axis anchor point.

		* the function _call()_ takes the incoming _selection_, as received from the prior link in the chain, and hands that selection off to any function as an argument. 

	* Cleaning up: we can even create a class for this "g" element and make configuration in CSS to style it. He also mentioned some conflicts between SVG / CSS naming, I am slightly confused.

	* We can specify _ticks(5)_ so that the axis only has 5 ticks. In fact, it will take tick as a suggestion, and find the optimal number of ticks, that might be slightly more or less than what you specified. This is very handy, as the data set change, d3 will make smart decision for you!

	* We can also format ticks using _d3.format_ and _xAxis.tickFormat_.
