### Notes for Today

Vertica is a powerful tool that I learned on the job, but I never had a good chance to dive in and learn a little bit more. Today, I found out about Vertica's [web based training], which roughly covers the following areas:

* [The building blocks of Vertica]

* [Installing Vertica and the Management Console]

* [Creating a database]

* [Loading data]

* [Introduction to Projection]

* [Query Execution]

* [Introduction to Analytics]

* [Event-based Analytics]

* [Timeseries Analytics]
