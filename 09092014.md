### Notes for Today

Continue to march on Coursera: Web Architecture. And we've entered the sixth and the last week of this course, focusing on the presentation/user interface layer.

* [**Introduction and Background**]: In this module, we talk about the client <-> web <-> presentation logic tier. Several terminologies are mentioned: The lyaout, wireframe, structure and navigation.

* [**HTML - Basic Syntax**]

	* The most important design principle of frontend work is the separation of content and presentation -- the meaning (i.e. semantics) of a document should be separated from how this meaning is presented to readers.
		* This allows the same content to be displayed different
		* You can change in one place how a recurrent item is styled throughout the whole document
		* By capturing the meaning, intelligent machine process has a better time in leveraging the data

	* HTML is a markup language that is declarative, this means you specify _what_ shoudl appear, but not _how_ it should look or behave.
		* It then introduce the concept of _element_, which has start and end tag, and the contents in between.
		* Elements may appear to be nested, this is how the document object model is formed
		* Attributes provide additional meaning and context, often used as a list of name-value pairs in side the start tag.
			* All HTML elements support the _id_ attribute (it's a global attribute), so it's unique in each HTML document
			* Another global attribute is _class_, which can be applied to a collection of elements
			* _anchor_ is an important HTML element as it is used to create hyperlinks, one can also associate it with an event attribute, so an action is triggered on that event. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/styling_html.png)

* [**HTML - Document Structure**]

	* Every HTML document has the following structure
	```html
	<!DOCTYPE html> <! -- it lets the web browser know what version of HTML the page is written in -->
	<html> <! -- this is the root of all HTML elements -->
		<head>
			<title> <!-- title is always required -->
			<link rel='stylesheet' href="theme.css"> <!-- use to specify the location of an external resource, it's always empty, it can only contain attributes -->
			<script src="myscript.js"></script> <!-- use to define a client-side script, or to include one from an external source, typically javascript. If src is present, then <script> element must be empty -->
			<meta> <!-- metadata can be used by browser, search engine (keyword) -->
		</head>

		<body> <!-- holds the actual contents -->
			Every HTML body element is classified as being either a block-level or a text-level element
		</body>
	</html>
	```

* [**HTML - Forms**]

	* Forms are the mechanism to build interactivity. In particular, user information is collected in an HTML form via a web browser, and then submitted to a web server for processing.

	* The flow:
		* Users "complete" a form by modifying its controls (entering text or making selections)
		* When a completed form is submitted, its data is first processed by a user agent, running as a part of the browser, before it is actually submitted to a processing agent on the server side.

	* The basic structure of a form element is as follows:
	```html
		<form action="http://www.example.com/log" method="get">
		<!-- form controls and other HTML markup -->
		<input type="submit" value="Log In">
		</form>
	```
		* the action attribute is used to specify the URL of the processing agent on the server side that will receive the data collected in the form.
		* The method attribute is used to specify the HTTP request method that user agent will use to send the data.
			
			* GET - in which case the form data will be sent as part of the URL (the data is url encoded), and append to the request url. 
				* URL encoding works as follows - the form data is separated from the URI by a "?", each name/value pair is separated by "&", and each name is separated from its value by "="
				* GET method should be used when a form is idempotent (it does not cause side effects) e.g. if the form data is used to search a database.
			
			* POST - in which case the form data must be included in the HTTP message request body
				* If the server-side processing associated with the form cause side effect e.g. modification of a database, then the POST method should be used.

	* _Controls_ were also introduced, althogh there are a lot of details how to use them (e.g. buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons)
