### Notes for Today

* Coursera: Reproducible Research 
	* **Week 1**: First, I watch the first week of "Reproducible Research" on Cousera Data Science Track, I realized that I have started this course, and have been taking notes (see 06082014.md). I revisit week 1 materials, finished the videos, and just follow my own notes.

* I also finished the remaining of **git-real**:

	* **Level 4: Collaboration Scenarios**
		* A git pull = git fetch + git merge origin/master
			* git fetch # it simply fetches the remote git repo into your local git repo (not your local working repo). see [schematic](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M2-L6-Git-Handout.pdf) here.
			* then git merge origin/master to really include the stuff we fetched into our active working directory 
		* Merge conflicts
			* If two people each have their own copies of the repo, and are editing on the same exact file. When you try to do a git pull (= fetch + merge), there will be a merging conflict!
			* The way to resolve this is manually edit the conflict and retain the things that you want.

	* **Level 5: Remote branches**
		* sometimes you want your branch to be worked on by someone else, so you need to expose that to other people. you would create your own remote branch
			* git checkout -b shopping_cart
			* git push origin shopping_cart (this creates a remote shopping_cart branch that tracks your local shopping car branch)
			* With this, when you git push, it always push to remote shopping cart.
		* Jane, your co-worker can now access your new remote branch. The next time she does a git pull, it will show her that there is a new branch in the remote repo called shopping_cart.
			* If she use git branch (she won't see it yet locally), but if she type git branch -r (she will see that new remote branch). If she then git checkout shopping_cart, she will have a local shopping_cart that tracks the remote shopping_cart, and she can now actively contribute the branch YOU created!
			* git remote show origin
				* gives you all remote branches
				* gives you all local branches and where they pull from
				* gives you where your local branches are push to
			* to remove remote branch, git push origin :shopping_cart (deletes the remote branch)
			* to remove local branch, use git branch -d/-D shopping_cart
		* What happen if the original creator of the remote branch pushes to it. (git remote prune origin) to clean up deleted and stale remote branches. (i.e. It's not just the creator of the remote branch who can remove the remote branch)
		* git push remote-repo local:remote (push our local branch to the specific remote branch of the remote repo)
		* Tagging: 
			* git tag - to list out all the tags
			* git checkout tagName - to checkout a particular commit with a tag
			* git tag -a tagName -m "tag description" - to add a new tag
			* git push --tags - to push new tags

	* **Level 6: Rebase**:
		* Git rebase: to rebase, first git fetch, remember, this only fetch origin master into your local repo (not working repo)
			1. move all changes of master which are not in orgin/master to a temporary area.
			2. Run all origin/master commits (this becomes the new base)
			3. Run all commits in the temporary area, one at a time (put every commits on top of the new base)
		* check out the admin example from 01:53 - 02:30
		* What about conflicts (again see 02:33 and on for an example), say you have two branches, each modified the same file, and yo uwant to rebase them:
			* git fetch (to get origin/master, with the modified file)
			* git rebase:
				* it will first put master in temp (with the modified file)
				* run all commits on origin/master (as new base)
				* then run all commits on master (on top of the new base)
			* At this point, since we need to put the two versions of modified files in 1 stream, we have a conflict. There are 3 options here:
				* fix the inconsistency, then git rebase --continue
					* then git add the file after modification
					* then git rebase --continue
				* git rebase --skip to skip this file/patch
				* git rebase --abort to give up on the rebasing operation

	* **Level 7: History and Configuration**:
		* colorizing the log: git config --global color.ui true
		* git log --pretty=oneline 
		* git log --pretty=format: "the actual format"
		* git log --oneline -p
		* git log --oneline --stat
		* git log --oneline --graph
		* git log --until=1.minute.ago / git log --since=1.day.ago
		
		* git diff HEAD^ ..HEAD (compare the diff of the second most recent and most recent
		* git diff sha1..sha2 (compare two commits by sha)
		* git diff branch1 branch2 (compare two branches)
		* git diff --since=1.weeka.go --until=1.minute.ago (compare repo based on two different timestamp)

		* git blame file //to see for eachline, the commit hash, who wrote it, when, which line, and the content

		* Excluding files: put the dir under .git/info/exclude
		* or put *.txt, /experiment/, specificFile.txt under .git/info/exclude would have the same effect.
		* exlcudeing from ALL copies, put it in .gitignore (e.g. exclude all log files because each user would have a different log). Make sure you commit the .gitignore as well!

		* Removing files: git rm filename (this remove both from file system and git).
		* Remember to git commit the rm operation 
		* Untracking files: git rm --cached (deleted only from git, not from your local file system)

		* config and aliasing are also cool.
