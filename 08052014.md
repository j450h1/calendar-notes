### Notes for Today

## Coursera Experiment Class

* [**blocking**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/experiments/lecture_slides/Week4/EFI2014-Class-4D.pdf):
	
	* Disturbance: cannot controlled, cannot measured
	* Covariates: can measured, but cannot controlled
	* Factors: can meaured, and can controlled

	* A subtlety: characteristics of a nuisance factor
		* the factor does vary during the experiment
		* it is controllable and measurable
		* but the factor is not the main focus of your experiment
		* Solution to deal with nuisance factor: randomization + blocking

	* When to use blocking:
		* "Does the process have to work successfully with different levels of the nuisance variable?"
			* If yes: you must actively manage them through blocking
			* If no: It means we have enough control of the system

	* The 2 level nuisance factor can be included by half fraction experiment.
		* I think if nuisance factor have more than 2 levels, then blocking scheme is more complicated. I don't really know how this is done.

* [**Fractional Factorails**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/experiments/lecture_slides/Week4/EFI2014-Class-4E.pdf)
	* Read the generator from the table
	* Rearrange then generator as I = ...
	* From the _defining relationship_ talking all combinations of the words, so that I = ...
	* Ensure that defining relationship has 2^p words
	* Compute the aliasing pattern
	* Is the aliasing problematic
		* If yes: reassign factor letters; or pcik another design (start over)
		* If no: yo uare ready to start your experiments

I think overall the remaining of week 4 materials here is quite confusing. I don't consider today's notes high quality.
