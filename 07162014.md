### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "R Programming"

* **Week 2**:
	* [**Control Structure I & II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/ControlStructures.pdf)
		* **_if else block_**
			* You can assign the whole if else statement into a variable (slide 4/14)
		* **_for_**
			*_for i in seq_along(x)_ is very handy for getting the index along x
			* _for i in seq_len(nrow(x)) is also very handy for getting the index along x
		* **_while_**
			* while loops can potentially result in infinite loops if not written properly
			* conditions are always evaluated from left to right
		* **_repeat_**
			* Not so oftenly used in statistical application, but good for optimization routines (see slide 11/12 as an example)
		* **_next, return_**
			* next is used to skip an interation of a loop
			* return signals that a function should exit and return a given value
	
	These control structures are primarily useful for writing programs; for command-line interactive work, the *apply functions are more useful.

	* [**Function**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/functions.pdf)
		* **Functions are R objects of class "function"**, and functions in R are "first class objects" (remember functional programming?). This means that they can be treated like any other R objects. In particular:
			* Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
			* Functions can be nested, so that you can define a function insdie of another function
			* The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.
		* **Function arguments & argument matching**
			* _formal arguments_ are the arguments included in the function definition, not all of them need to be used
			* R function arguments can be matched positionally or by name. When an argument is matched by name, it is "taken out" of the argument list and the remaining unnamed arguments are matched in the order that they are listed in the function definition! (slide 5/13)
			* Named arguments are useful on the command line when you have a long argument list and most of the arguments would be set to default values (e.g. plot)
			* It also has partial matching
		* **Lazy Evaluation**: arguments to functions are evaluated lazily, so they are evaluated only as needed. (slide 9/13, 10/13)
		* **_..._ argument**: 
			* indicate a variable number of arguments that are usually passed on to other functions. 
			* Useful for function in which we don't know the number of arguments in advance (e.g. paste, cat)
			* One catch with ... is that any arguments that appear after ... on the argument list must be named and cannot be partially matched.

	* [**Coding Standards**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/CodingStandard.pdf)
		* Always use an editor, indent your code, limit the width of your code, limit your function definitions to logical units -- good for visualization and debugging.

	* [**Scoping Rules I & II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/Scoping.pdf)
		* **Binding**:
			* When R tries to bind a value to a symbol, it searches through a series of (hierarchical) environment to find hte appropriate value. Starting from global environment = user's workspace, then it search the namespace of each of the package. Can use _search()_ to look at the ordering of the environments
			* When a user loads a package with _library_, the namespace of that package gets put in position 2 of the search list (be default) and everything else gets shifted down the list.
		* **Scoping rules**:
			* Scoping rules determine how a value is associated with a free variable in the a function. A free varaible is not a formal argument and are not local varaible (assigned inside the function body). 
			* **R uses lexical scoping rule** -- this means the vlaues of free varaibles are searched for in the environment in which the funciton was defined.
				* Environment is nothing but pairs of (symbol, values) 
				* If the value is not in the environment the function is defined, it will then search its parent environment, until we hit the top environment (usually the global environment = workspace). 
				* If it's not in the global environment, it will keep looking up until we hit the empty environment, in which case we throw an error.
	* [**Vectorized Operation**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/Vectorized.pdf) No notes
	
	* [**Date and Time**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/Dates.pdf)
		* **Dates** are represented by the Date class
			* x <- as.Date(character string)
		* **Times** are represented by the POSIXct or the POSIXlt class
			* POSIXct is just a very large integer under the hood; useufl when yo uwant to store times in a data frame
			* POSIXlt is a list underneath and it stores a bunch of other meta data like day, week, day of the year ...etc
		* _strptime_ is also handy in case your dates are written in a different format
		* We can do date operation on two date/time objects of the same class
