### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "R Programming"

* **Week 1**:
	* [**Asking questions**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/help.pdf):
		* Do your homework first and try to solve the problem yourself first
		* Let others know what you have done to try to solve the problems, describe in details the step you took. Be succint about the subject line
		* **DO**:
			* describe the goal, not the step
			* Be explicit about your question
			* Do provide the minimum amount of information necessary
			* Be courteous
			* Follow up with the solution
		* **DON'T**:
			* claim that you found a bug
			* Email multiple mailing lists at once
			* Ask others to debug your broken code without giving a hint as to what sort of problem they should be searching for
	* [**Date Types I**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/DataTypes.pdf):
		* Atomic classes of objects: **character, numeric, integer, complex, logical**. The most basic object is a vector (can contain objects of the same class). List can contain objects of different class.
		* R objects can have attributes. Using _attribute()_
	* [**Data Types II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/DataTypes.pdf)
		* _c()_ function can be used to cerate vectors of object
		* If mixing objects, coercion occurs so that every element in the vector is of the same class (using the least common ancestor). Explicit coercion is also possible using _as.numeric_ or _as.logical_
		* **Matricies** are vectors with a dimension attributes. The dimension attribute is itself an integer vector of length 2. Matrices are constructed column-wise. cbind-ing and rbind-ing are also handy.
		3. **list** are a special type of vector that can contain elements of different classes. 
	* [**Data Types III**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/DataTypes.pdf)
		* **Factors** are used to represent categorical data. Use _factor()_ to create a factor. unclass(myFactor) will return the numeric representation of the levels. The order of the levels can be set using the _levels_ argument. The first level is the _baseline_ factor.
		* **Missing Values**: NaN are NA, the converse is not True. Can use _is.na()_ and _is.nan()_.
		* **Data Frame** is a sepcial type of list where every element of the list has to have the same length. Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows. Unlike matrices, the columns can hold different classes of objects. Often use _read.table_ or _data.frame_ to create a df.
	* [** Subsetting I**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/Subsetting.pdf)
		* **[** always returns an object of the same class as the original, can be used to select more than one element
		* **[[** is used to extract elements of a list of a data frame. The returned element class will not necessarily be a list or data frame.
		* **$** is used to extract elements of a list or data frame by name; semantics are similar to [[.
		* When subsetting matrix, can use _drop = FALSE_ to preserve the return value as a matrix.
	* [** Subsetting II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/Subsetting.pdf)
		* For a list, x[1] gets me a list, where x[[1]] gives the type of the element. To use the $ sign, we need to use the literal symbol.
		* x[[c(1,3)]] is the same as x[[1]][3]
		* The $ has partial matching! slide-11/14
		* If there are multiple things and you want to take the subset with no missing values, using _complete.case()_! slide 14/14.
	* [**Reading and Writing in R - I**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/reading_data_I.pdf)
		* read.table, read.csv for reading tabular data. Default sep are ' ' and ',' respectively.
		* readLines, for reading lines of a text file
		* source for reading R source code
		* Also have dget, load, unserialize
		* **Reading large dataset** (great!)
			* Estimate if your data set is larger than the RAM you have (see slide 9/9 for an example, 2^20 bytes = 1MB. Use nrow * ncol * 8 = total bytes required)
			* supply colClasses (see slide 7/9)
			* set nrows
	* [**Reading and Writing in R - II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/reading_data_II.pdf)
		* dumping and dputing are useful because the resulting textual format is edit-able, and in the case of corruption, potentially recoverable. Textual format goes well with version control, less likely to be corrupted. but generally less space efficient.
		* Multiple objects can be deparsed using the dump function and read back in using _source_. (slide 4/9)
		* Use file, gzfile, bzfile, url to read external sources.
		* Reading external using the connection '_con_' paradigm (see slide 7/9)
