### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes
I don't need this anymore. The d3 book has long been part of my weekly ritual, and I am committed to finishing it. We are more than 2/3 way there.

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 10](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch10.html):

This chapter is about "interactivity", i.e. making your graphs interactive using the construct of 'event listener' (which we briefly learned this in chapter 9). In this chapter, we discuss interactive examples such as how to highlight a particular 'rect' on a bar chart on 'mouseover' or 'mouseout'; how to re-sort the data and re-arrange them on 'mouseclick'; and how to provide different tooltip to surface 'details on demand'.

	* [**Event Listener**](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch10.html#_binding_event_listeners):
		* Just like we can bind data to DOM elements in d3, we can also **bind event listener to a single or multiple DOM elements**. 
		* The event listner construct is based on the 'event model' in Javascript, so D3 recognize all standard Javascript events, suc has 'mouseover', 'click' ... etc.
		* Remember, events don't happen in vacuum. They are always called on a specific element!
		* Event listener always take two part:
			* Defining particular event we care about
			* Defining the behavior to happen after the event occur
		* You can bind these event listeners right after when the element is created.

	* **Example 1: highlighting**
		* One poor man's approach is to achieve this interactivity using CSS rules alone, no Javascript required. Check out the selector _:hover_.
		* Using the new CSS3 transitions, we can also apply some slow transition to the change.
		* Alternatively, we can do it with D3 and javascript by creating a event listener on 'mouseover' event. Inside the event listener, we define an anonymous function that changes the attribute of 'fill'.
			* In particular, the "this" construct is being used again. Just remember this: Within anonymous functions, D3 automatically sets the context of 'this' so it references “the current element upon which we are acting.”
			* We can also make sure the interactivity restore to the original color on 'mouseout'.
			* Feel free to add transition() and duration() to make the interactivity smoother.
	
	* **Side note: Pointer events on overlapping elements**:
		* Mouse events are triggered only on elements with pixels that can be “touched” by the mouse. If two elements overlap, and the mouse moves over the element that is “on top” -- the mouseover event will be triggered on the frontmost element, and not on the element behind it.
		* Remember that in SVG, elements placed later in the DOM are rendered visually “in front” of earlier elements. This can make visual interaction counter-intuitive (see _06_smoother.html_). 
		* The solution is '_pointer-events: none' syntax in CSS rule. This says that this element shouldn't trigger any pointer events (such as click, mouseover, mouseout), so just behave as if the element is not there.
		* Alternatively, you can specify the style in d3 in element creation: _svg.append("text").style("pointer-events", "none");_.

	* **Grouping SVG elements**:
		* Note that g group elements do not, by themselves, trigger any mouse events. The reason for this is that g elements have no pixels! Only their enclosed elements—like rects, circles, and text elements—have pixels.
		* However, this construct is handy. To avoid the inconsistency of overlapping elements, just put everything under 1 group, then we will not have that problem anymore!

	* **Click to Sort**:
		* This section demonstrate how we can wrap another custom sort function insdie the anonymous function in the event listener.
		* It also demonstrate the sort method upon a selection of DOM elements: _d3.selectAll("rect").sort(comparator function)_.
			* The important thing here is the comparator function, we need to let the sort function know how to sort. Luckily we have helper fucntions like d3.ascending or d3.descending. (Look how nested we hare (event_listener(anonymous function(custom sort(sort(comparator))))))! yay!).
		* One cool trick for this kind of re-ordering of data is to animate per-element delay use _delay(function(d, i) return i * 50;)_ (remember from Chapter 9?). This makes the whole re-ordering continuous and smooth. Very cool!
		* Also mentioned that sometimes if you have several interactivity on several events, the most recent event would take over. So often in design, we have to make choices so that they don't interfere. The solution in this example was to make highlight into CSS, and the rest as d3 transitions.
		* We can also sort in descending or ascending order by adding a little bit more codes.

	* **Tooltips**:
		* In interactive visualizations, tooltips are small overlays that present data values. In many cases, it’s not necessary to label every individual data value in the default view, but that level of detail should still be accessible to users. That’s where tooltips come in.
		* Default Browser Tooltip:
			* To make these tooltips, simply inject a title element into whatever element should have the tooltip applied
		* SVG Element Tooltip:
			* Many ways to do it, here the author demonstrate on each mouseover, a new value label is created, and on mouseout it's destroyed.
			* It's worth looking at how to destroy it on mouseout: _d3.select("#tooltip").remove();_
		* HTML div Tooltip:
			* use HTML tooltip when:
				* You want to achieve a visual effect that isn’t possible or well-supported with SVG (such as CSS drop shadows)
				* You need the tooltips to extend beyond the frame of the SVG image
			* Design pattern: 
				* Create a div, assigned it with #tooptip and #value ids.
				* Style the div
				* Reference the #tooltip and #value id on mouseover event.
				* Use the 'hidden' class to show or hide the HTML tooltip.
