#### Flask Learning Path

##### Intro & Motivation
One of my 2015 Q1 goals is to learn how to build interactive web application for visualization. The purpose is to extend my skillsets and make my analyses more expressive, so the 'insights' are not confined on paper or powerpoint presentation. 


##### Flask
In the previous quarters, I have spent some time learning the foundation of building web application; I've learned d3.js; and I've encountered several different web frameworks. There are many choices -- Ruby on Rails, Django, flask...etc. Amongst these tools, I find that Flask is very appealing because:

* It's built on top of Python (so I can practice more)
* It's light-weight, easy to learn
* It seems to be the de-facto tool for Insights Data Science and Data Engineering Programs
* There are comprehensive learning materials from Udacity as well as Twitter University
* The combination of flask + d3.js also seem common place

As a result, I decided to embark my journey in learning flask. In the following sections, I will highlight some of the learning materials, paving the path of how one should study flask, without talking about the specifics.
