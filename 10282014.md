#### How to start a start-up: Culture and Hiring

Talks from Ben Silbermann (Pinterest) and Patrick Collison & John Collison on hiring and building a team.

#### Other Interesting Materials

* I found this website from O'reilly called [O'reilly Atlas] which contains several nice books that are presented in e-book form. Scott Murray's interactive data visualization is one of them. Some of the other ones that seems relevant:

	* [Git Pocket Guide]
	* [JavaScript Cookbook]
	* [Python Cookbook]

#### Python cookbook

Glimpsed through Ch.1: the basics. Specifically, 03_numpy.ipynb & 04_magic.ipynb

#### Measuring Causal Effects in the Social Science
I missed both module 3 & module 4, I should probably catch up soon!
