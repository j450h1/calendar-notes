#### [**Stanford CS 183B: How to Start a Startup**]

"Everything we (Y combinator) know about how to start a startup, for free, from some of the world experts". Being in SV, I think this class cannot be more appropriate. Keep this class in my radar, I am planning to spend every Tuesday and Thursday in the next 10 weeks to learn about building a startup.

* [9/23/14]: Sam Altman (President of Y Combinator) & Dustin Moskovitz (Facebook Cofounder & Asana Cofounder)

* [Sam's Talk]: 
	* You need a great 'idea', 'product', 'team', and 'execution' with luck between 0 and 10,000.
	* Good startup sounds like a bad idea but is the right thing to do
	* The idea comes first, the company must have a mission. 
	* You need to be able justify why now is the time. 
	* While you are a student:
		* Think about new ideas
		* Meet potential cofounders
	* Great idea -> great product -> great company. 
	* Without great product, none of the business stuff would matter. * Startup rarely failed because of competition, they failed because they don't have a good product.
	* It's much better to build something a small subset of the users love than building something that a lot of users like. You will have a much better growth trajectory with the former.
	* Be fanatical about pretty much everything, including the details
	* Be manual, know your customer really well, and get their feedbacks (i.e. user research).
	* Metrics: make sure to focus on growth

* [Dustin's talk]:
	* There are many WRONG reasons to be an entrepreneuer:
		* It's glamorous
		* You will be the boss
		* Flexibility
		* $$$
	* On glamour: The ugly side of being a founder
		* You bet on yourself
		* Responsilibity: your team bet the best years of their life on you
		* You're always on call
		* Fundrasing
		* Unwanted media attention
	* On you're be the boss: actually, as a startup founder, everyone is your boss. You need to make hard decisions, and make the least disappointment to everyone.
	* On flexibility: You're always on call. You're a role model, and you always work.
	* On $$$: You'll make about the same or much more as an early employee at a breakout company than starting your own. The expected value is not necessarily at when you do startup.
	* Maximizing impact is important: Google Maps, Gchat, Like wouldn't not have been done without the massive user base, existing infrastructure, or working with an established team.
	* The best reason to do a startup is that you can't not do it.
