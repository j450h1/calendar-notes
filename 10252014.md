#### d3.js warm up + return to work edition

There are about only 7 thin weeks left for this year, and I made the commitment starting of Q4 to produce an high quality interactive d3 visualization and showcase to other people/co-workers. I really need to start working on this. Today's exercise serves two purposes:

* Warming Up
	
	* I found [Square's New Hire Orientation (NHO) intro to d3.js] on datatau last week, and I thought their review is minimal but very succient. I should use this reference as my warm-up exercise in the future if I forget about `d3.js`. Here are the basics:

		* Like Scott Murray's book, it first did a quick review of the `web standard trio`. Namely, HTML, CSS, and DOM and it shows how they are related to each other. DOM manipulation is also introduced and we started to get a flavor of d3's powerful `selection` methods.

		* It then jumps in to the basic of a graph. First, it showed us the hard way, and then explain how easy it is to be done in d3:
			
			* **Scale** - reviewed `d3.scale.linear()` and `d3.time.scale()`; Its configuration via `domain` and `range`, and how the scale itself is a function!

			* **Axes** - reviewed `var xAxis = d3.svg.axis().scale(what_we_defined_above).orient('bottom').ticks(4)` and how we called it in `svg.append('g').attr('class', 'x axis').call(xAxis)`.

		* Then we move on to data binding 

			* **Selection**: `d3.selectAll()` selects the DOM elements. In fact, in d3, we can pre-select them even if they are not already on the canvas.

			* **Data**: `d3.selectAll('p').data([array])` is where we brings in the data into the operations. This step is sometimes called 'data join'.

			* **Enter**: `d3.selectAll('p').data([1,2,3]).enter()` is where the datum really show up in the console.
			
		* BUT WAIT, it's not just about `enter`. In fact, when we select & bind the data. We can then either 'enter', 'update' or 'remove' the data. This is the part that was not well explained in this tutorial. Luckily, we have Mike Bostock's three little circle & my own investigation here based on CS 171's class:

			* [Three little circle](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/circles/)
			* [Calendar Note 09072014.md](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/09072014.md)
			* These two articles are quite effective in capturing the concept, read them!

		* Finally, with the basic set up, we can be more fancy and introduce

			* Transitions
			* Listner events + callback functions

		* [Optionally] It also talked about d3.layouts, the basic idea is that certain layouts are difficult to draw, so d3 breaks it up into a two step process:

			* Layouts - transform your raw data with additional metadata so d3 can easily manipulate it (raw -> pie chart arcs, raw -> layers of data for stackplot)

			* The actual plotting, which you would never remember if you don't do them.


* Finding interesting dataset to play with

	* I am thinking about geo data from Twitter, Airbnb, or Uber. It's fun to play with geo data

#### Intro to Linux: Chapter 17: Processes

* Processes are used to perform various tasks on the system. Processes can be single-threaded or multi-threaded. Processes can be of different types such as interactive and non-interactive.

	* ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/process_type.png)

	* Every process has a unique identifier (PID) to enable the operating system to keep track of it.

	* The nice value, or niceness, can be used to set priority.

	* ps provides information about the currently running processes. (static, one time information)

* You can use top to get constant real-time updates about overall system performance as well as information about the processes running on the system.

	* Load average indicates the amount of utilization the system is under at particular times. (1 min, 5 mins, 15 mins)

	* Linux supports background and foreground processing for a job.

	* at executes any non-interactive command at a specified (future) time.

	* cron is used to schedule tasks that need to be performed at regular intervals.

#### Additional Materials

* dplyr: Joshua told me it's very good, and it has the SQL like + chaining + much faster advantages. Check out:
