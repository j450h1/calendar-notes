### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "Reproducible Research"

* **Week 1 Materials**:
	* [**Reproducible Research**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata/slides/ReproResearch.pdf):
		* The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence is replication of findings and conducting studies with independent investigators, Data, Analytical methods, Laboratories, Instruments. But it's not always possible. So what's the second best that we can do? Reproducible Research: Make analytic data and code available so others may reproduce findings.

	* [**Structure of a Data Analysis I**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata/slides/structureOfADataAnalysis1.pdf) & [**Structure of a Data Analysis II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata/slides/structureOfADataAnalysis2.pdf)
		* **Define the question**
		* **Define the ideal data set**
			The data set depends on your goal:
			* Descriptive - a whole population
			* Exploratory - a random sample with many variables measured
			* Inferential - the right population, randomly sampled
			* Predictive - A training and a test set from the same population
			* Causal - data from a randomized study
			* Mechanistic - data about all components of the system 
		* **Determine what data you can access**
		* **Obtain the data**
		* **Clean the data**
		* **Exploratory Data Analysis**
			* Look at summaries of the data
			* Check for missing data
			* Create exploratory plots
		* **Statistical Prediction/Modeling**
			* Should be informed by the results of your exploratory analysis
			* Transformation/processing should be accounted for when necessary
			* Measures of the uncertainty should be reported (e.g. accuracy in prediction model)
		* **Interpret Results**
			* Use the appropriate language
			* Give an explanation
			* Interpret coefficients
			* Interpret measures of uncertainty
		* **Challenge results**
			Others are bound to do it, so you might as well be ahead of the game
			* Challenge all steps: question, data source, processing, analysis, conclusion
			* Challenge measure of uncertainty
			* Challenge choice of terms in to include in the models
			* Think of potential alternative analyses
		* **Synthesize/write up results**
			* Lead with the question!
			* Summarize the analyses into a story
			* Don't include every analysis, include it when needed for the story, or to address a challenge
			* Order analyses according to the story, rather than chronologically
			* Inlcude pretty graphs
		* Create reproducible code

	* [**Organizing a Data Analysis**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata/slides/organizingADataAnalysis.pdf): How you should set up your project folders (makes a lot of sense!)
		* Data
			* Raw data 
				* _If accessed from web, include url, description, and data accessed. Use git log to document this_
			* Processed data
				* _data should be tidy_
				* _The processing script should describe how we arrive at the processed data_
		* Figures
			* Exploratory figures
			* Final figures
		* R code
			* Raw / unused scripts
			* Final scripts
			* R Markdown files
		* Text
			* README files
				* _not necessary if you already have RMarkdown_
				* _Should contain step by step analysis_
			* Text of analysis / report
				* _It should tell a story_
				* _It should not include every analysis you performed_
