#### Ben Horowitz: Nailing the hard thing about hard things

Talk from Stanford's Entreprenuership Corners. The skeleton of the talks involved:

* Importance of people skills -- trying to understand from people's perspective.

* Learning in Lare organization -- from large organization, you can understand the pain point (why does it take so long to build something, to merge code, to reach to a decision). When you start your own, you will know how to avoid those pain points.

* Peacetime v.s. Wartime CEO -- management book doesn't tell you how to behave during wartime. If you are a largely successful company that has monopoloy, you have the luxury to do all the typical management stuff - delegation, training people to be better at making higher quality decisions. Wartime CEO is much much harder. You have to make very difficult decision very quickly. Being a wartime CEO is also hard, since you need to constantly evaluate and course correct others, and it's not a human nature to do this.

* Build a Great Product First -- That comes first, anything comes second.

* Disrupting the Venture Capital Industry -- Venture Capital is world where great VC fund great companies, and great companies only want to be funded by great VC, it's a self perpetuating process. It's great if you are already at the top, but it's hard otherwise. What A16Z does is that they crack this problem give different values to their entrepenuer, they teach them exactly what is it to run a company, and they have many connections in many functions (marketing, finance, technical resourcing...etc)

* When leaders shoud let go -- You need to find executives who are better than you in that functional area in order to gain leverage. If you always second guess your executives then you are not getting leverage. You want leverages in all area, the leader's job is to gatekeep the vision.

Some Q&A:

* Silicon Valley has network effect, and it's the place where people want to be. It's the place where the whole eco-system is intact. You find people who have knowledge in Android, iOS, cloud computing all in one place.

* If he were to be in Stanford, he would focus on crypto-currency and bioinformatics. He also mentioned about databricks, which is a new big data company that leverage Apache Spark.
