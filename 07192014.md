### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "R Programming"

* **Week 4**:
	* **str**: compactly display the internal structure of an R object, well suited to compactly display the abbreviated contents of possibly nested lists. Roughly one line per basic object.
		* Since a function is also an object, str(f) will give you the function signature. e.g. _str(f) = function(arg0, arg1, arg2, ...)_
		* Can use on any data type (e.g. _str(airquality)_, dataframe, list ...)
		* "The most useuful function in all of R" - Roger Peng

	* [**Simulation I & II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/simulation.pdf)
		* Remember the r (random number generation), d (density), p (cumulative) ,r (quantile). Each distribution has these 4 functions
		* Make sure that you set the seed with _set.seed_ to ensure reproducibility. Always set the random number seed when conducting a simulation!
		* Generating random numbers from a linear model
			* (see slide 9/15 and 14/15) Use linear and poisson as examples.
		* _sample_ function can be use for drawing with/without replacement, permutation

	* [**R Profiler I && II**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/profiler.pdf)
		* Why is my code so slow? **Profiling** is a systematic way to examine how much time is spend in different parts of a program. Useful when trying to optimize your code
		* General principles of optimization: design first, then optimize. Remember: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Measure (collect data), don't guess.
		* **System.time()**: Takes an arbitrary R expression as input and returns the amount of time taken to evluate the expression
			* **user time**: time charge to the CPU for this expression
			* **elapsed time**: "walk clock" time - what the user experienced
				* elapsed > user time when CUP spends a lot of time waiting around (slide 7/17)
				* elapsed < user time if your machine has multiple cores/processors (slide 7/17)
			* Can wrap a longer expression direclty into system.time (slide 8/17)
			* The issue with system.time is that it assumes you know where the bottleneck is in your code.
		* **Rprof()** function starts the profiler in R. The summaryRprof() summarize the output of Rprof. DO NOT use summaryRprof in conjunction with Rprof
			* Rprof keeps track of the function call stack at regularly sampled intervals and tabulates how much time is spend in each function. 
			* see (slide 12/17 and 13/17 for an output example)
			* by.total v.s. by.self
				* by.total gives you the percentage of time the stack is spent in the computation. This is often not useful, especially for top level function calls, because most of the them they don't do much, they just keep calling helper functions deeper in the stack. But if we use by.total, it would appear they spent 100% of the time.
				* by.self is a better measure -- it measure how much time the function really spent subtracting all the time it's deeper level helper functions are called.
			* Can also configure sampling interval and get the total sampled time
			* This profiler of showing the breakdown of function time spent highlights again the importance of decomposing your function into logical pieces

	* [**Scoping Rule**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/rprog/lecture_slides/profiler.pdf)
		* Just a case study - pretty cool in how the code is structured for writing a function (make.NegLogLik) that returns a function (nLL) which is feed into optim or optimize routine.
		* In R, optim and optimize usually solve minimization problem, so if you want to max the log likelihood function, you will have to minimize the negative likelihood (think of a simple picture)
