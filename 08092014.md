### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [Interactive Data Visualization with D3.js: Chapter 9](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch09.html):

	* This is a long and complicated chapter, let's be patient and spend time to document the learning here. Plan:
		* Saturday: Finish tahe Chapter
		* Sunday: Document the learning from Chapter 9

	* **Recap**:
		* _data()_ binds data to elements, but also returns the **update selection**.
		* The update selection can contain _enter_ and _exit_ selections, which can be accessed via _enter()_ and _exit()_.
		* When there are _more values than elements_, an enter selection will reference the placeholder, not-yet-existing elements.
		* When there are _more elements than values_, an exit selection will reference the elements without data.
		* Data joins determine how values are matched with elements.
		* By default, data joins are performed by index, meaning in order of appearance.
		* For more control over data joins, you can specify a key function.
		* The sequence _enter, update, exit_ is not set in stone. Depending on your design goals, you might want to update first, then eneter new elements, and finally exit old ones. It all depends on what makes the most logical and aesthetic sense.
