### Notes for Today

## Continue to review in more details, the potential classes I can read.

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/): Finished the first two videos on "Introduction to 6.00" and "Core elements of a program". I think it's a bit slow, so I will have to watch a few more lectures to know if it is good.

* [Interaction Data Visualization for the web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html): Today I read through [chapter 1: introduction](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch01.html) & [chapter 2: Introduction to D3](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch02.html). I think overall the explanation is clear, and this is something that I can really read on! *note: I particularly like the section where he discussed the history of D3.

* [Time series class](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/): I read through the [EDA lecture](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/lectures/02-eda.pdf) & [Decomposition and Trends](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/lectures/03-trend.pdf). I think overall the lecture notes are self-explanatory, so I can still follow them. But that's only the first few lectures, I will need to keep reading to know.


## Other miscellaneous learning

* ggplot2 line graphs with aesthetic 'group': two useful links
