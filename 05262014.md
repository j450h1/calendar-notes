### Notes for Today

## Continue to evaluate potentially interesting classes

* [MIT 6.00SC Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/): Finished the first two videos on "Introduction to 6.00" and "Core elements of a program". I think it's a bit slow in the beginning, so to do its justice, I will watch a few more lectures before evaluating whether this is a good course.

* [Interaction Data Visualization for the web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html): Today I read through [chapter 1:       introduction](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch01.html) & [chapter 2: Introduction to D3](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/  1230000000345/ch02.html). I think overall the explanation is clear, and this is something that I can really read on! *note: I particularly like the    section where he discussed the history of D3.

* [Time series class](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/): I read through the [EDA lecture](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/lectures/02-eda.pdf) & [Decomposition  and Trends](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/lectures/03-trend.pdf). I think overall the lecture notes are self-explanatory, so I can still follow them. But that's only the first few lectures, I will need to keep reading to know.


## Some useful information on learning + tiny bit of reflection on my learning process

* [Scott Young's 12 month MIT challenge](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/mit-challenge/): A friend of Cal Newport. He seems to have an insatiable appetite for acquiring knowledge, and that is something I can echoed with. I was interested in seeing if there is any insight that I can learn from his 12 month MIT challenge for my own learning process, here are some of his take-aways:
    
    * Create an exciting, but specific, mission.
    * Build a curriculum or find one.
    * Be public in your quest.
    
    * [Guest post of this challenge at Cal Newport's page](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/10/26/mastering-linear-algebra-in-10-days-astounding-experiments-in-ultra-learning/). He described his strategy for learning faster as follows:
    
        * **Coverage**: This means finding the right curriculum, learning materials, and absorb them (ideally at 1.5x speed). He argued that "a mistake students often make is believing this stage is the most important. In many ways this is the least efficient stage because the amount you can learn per unit of time invested is much lower"
        
        * **Practice**: Make sure to
            * Get immediate feedback
            * Do not grind problems. The problems are there so you can identify the gap in your understanding 
        
        * **Insight**: "The purpose of coverage & practice is to get you to a point where you know what you don't understand". Insight is the step to narrow that gap of understanding. His techniques involves:

            * Get a piece of paper
            * Write at the top the idea or process you want to understand
            * Explain the idea, as if you were teaching it to someone else. (You will get stuck at some point, and that's where you don't understand things, clear them!). Make sure to:

                * Use Analogy
                * Use visualization
                * Simplify the explanation

**Some observations**:
* I agree with him, I might have put too much emphasis on coverage, because I always feel like that is the step, and the ONLY step towards knowledge internalization. I might be wrong, this means that I should probably spread out this phase to daily activitie (e.g. commuting).
* I am completely lacking on the practice part, this is bad, because I do not know where I do not understand.
* The Knowledge Vault construct is very much related to the Insight part. I think I have done a great job in summarizing my learnings in LaTex, but I was not actively in explaining out loud the concepts!

## Other Miscellaneous learning materials

* ggplot2 line graphs with aesthetic 'group': two useful links
    * [Plotting lines and the group aesthetic in ggplot2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10357768/plotting-lines-and-the-group-aesthetic-in-       ggplot2)
    * [geom_line() doesn't draw lines?](http://kohske.wordpress.com/2010/12/27/faq-geom_line-doesnt-draw-lines/)

* [Github Markdown Simulator](http://markable.in/editor/): Very handy for development of the notes

* [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists): Again, very handy
