### Notes for Today

* Continue to watch Coursera: Experiment Class week 6 materials. I finished watching the video, but at this point I don't think it's a great class for me to learn experimentation, it just seem a bit too mechanical for me. So I am not going to summarize the notes here in here.

* As a compensation, I went back to watch [**Git Real**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ifxcvOFYMg&list=PLgFxj4c5cLKZVFtIiQ5U-IrmIZoxiQ5hd&index=8), or the first 4 levels. I think I should summarize them here, but will do it another time. Cutting myself some slack today.
