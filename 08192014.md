### Notes for Today

* Continue to watch Coursera: Experiment Class week 6 materials. I finished watching the video, but at this point I don't think it's a great class for me to learn experimentation, it just seem a bit too mechanical for me. So I am not going to summarize the notes here in here.

* As a compensation, I went back to watch [**Git Real**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ifxcvOFYMg&list=PLgFxj4c5cLKZVFtIiQ5U-IrmIZoxiQ5hd&index=8), particularly the first 3 levels. Here are the basics:

	* **Level 1**:
		* git config --global color.ui true #pretty command line colors
		* git init creates local git repo
		* Untracked files are files that are neither in staging nor commited
		* git add --all #adds all new or modified files
		* In commit message, use present tesne and not the past tense
		* git add docs/*.txt #add all txt files in docs directory
		* git add docs/ #add all files in docs directory
		* git add "*.txt" #add all .txt files in the project

	* **Level 2**:
		* git diff #show unstaged differences since last commit
		* git diff --staged #view staged differences
		* git reset HEAD LICENSE #unstage the LICENSE file
		* git checkout -- LICENSE #blow away all changes since last commit
		* git commit -a -m #add changes from all tracked files and commit, doesn't add new (untracked) files
		* git reset --soft HEAD^ #undo last commit, put changes back to staging
		* git add todo.txt, git commit --amend -m "message" #whatever has been staged is added to last commit
		* git reset --hard HEAD^ #undo last commit and all changes
		* git remote add origin https://github.com... # to add a remote repo
		* git remote rm #remove remote repo
		* git remote -v #shows the bookmarked remote repos
		* git push -u origin (remote branch) master (local branch)
		* git pull #get remote and put it in our local repo

	* **Level 3**:
		* git clone address #create a local copy of the remote repo, and it also adds the 'orgin' remote, point it to the clone URL. Finally, check out the initial branch (most likely master)
		* git branch #create a new branch
		* git checkout branch #swtich around branches
		* git merge cat #merge brings one branch's changes into another
			* The idea of a fast forward is that the master hasn't changed, but we merge in some special branch. In that case, master would just be "fast forwarded"
			* The idea of a recursive merge is when we created topic branch, made changes, went back to master, made changes, commit, back to topic branch
