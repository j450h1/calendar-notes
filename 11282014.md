### SQL 

From Hadley Wickham's tutorial on dplyr, he specifically mentioned about two introductory articles about SQL, and I find them quite useful. Here is the summary of each:

* [How does Index work in SQL]: An introduction to query planning! A few of key concepts to keep in mind:

	* **SQL is a declarative language** - When programming in SQL you tell the system what you want to compute, NOT how to compute it. The task of figuring out the _how_ is delegated to the _query planner_ subsystem within the SQL database engine. 

	* Each record (row) in a SQL table has row_id (the unique identifier).

	* Searching - corresponds to **WHERE CLAUSE** in SQL. To find a specific row, we need to perform a binary search on the unique identifier column, and it takes `log(N)` time.

	* Sorting - corresponds to **ORDER BY** in SQL. The time complexity of a sorting operation is N * log(N)

For search, tables without indices need to do a **full table scan**, which takes `N` time (N is the number of rows in the table). This is very inefficient, and this is where indices can speed things up significantly for search!
	
	* We can lookup by rowid, but this is no different from doing a full table scan.
	
	* If we keep a index with the schema (columnOfInterest, rowId), then instead of doing a full table scan, we can do a binary search on the indices to find the specific (columnOfInterest, rowID*) combination, and do another binary search for rowID* in the original table. The cost here is only 2 binary search (which takes `2 * log(N)`). Multiple result rows is the same, since the (columnOfInterest, rowID) are stacked together. The spped up is `N / log(N)`!

	* When the WHERE clause has several filtering condition, we can either keep one index, and then do filtering on the original table, or we can keep multi-column indices, and do the search on the indices. Naturally, the idea of multi-column indices can be extended to "covering indices", where all the columns are being put in the index.

For sorting, when we use an index, we go through each row of the index, then do a binary search to find the row, so the cost is still `N * log(N)`, exactly the same if we were to sort the original table. SO there is no speed up. However, when we sort by a covering index, then the cost becomes `N` instead of `N * log(N)`. What is the trade-off here? I think we have to use more memory to store the index (essentially the same as the original table).

Finally, a proper ordered index will allow us to perform sorting and search efficiently! Again, all these examples demonstrated how indices can be super helpful to speeding on the query!

* [10 Easy Step to completely understand SQL]:
	* SQL is declarative
	* SQL syntax is not "well-ordered": The lexical order and the logical order are not the same. For lexical order, we have SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, UNION, ORDER BY. For logical order, we exactly have FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, SELECT, SELECT, UNION, ORDER BY. 
	* SQL is all about table references, this is why we have FROM first, and everything else comes second. In fact, SELECT statements usually do not come until the very end.
	* The power of table references can be compounded by JOIN.
	* SQL GROUP BY transforms previous table references
	* SQL DISTINCT, UNION, ORDER BY, and OFFSET are simple again once we have the right table references.
