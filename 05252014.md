# Introduction to this week's notes
As of last week (May 17, 2014), I finally finished a 20 week (10 weeks EdX active learning + 10 weeks knowledge vault summarization) stretch of the course ["Introduction to Statistical Learning with R"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). As I ramp down the effort, I think this is a good time to take a breath first search approach and investigate some of the interesting DS materials out there. This week's transition period is meant to investigate which courses are worth-while for my next phase of exploration.

## The Open-Source Data Science Masters
* **Description**: This is a github repo that keeps track of all the Data Science related resources that one can learn from internet, MOOC, textbooks...etc. The project was initiated by Clare Corthell, a Stanford-educated engineer. 
* **Why this is on my radar**: I love the idea of crowd-sourcing DS learning materials -- There is only so much that I can do alone. Users can contribute to the project by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo, making changes, and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). This is a pretty powerful collective efforts, because I have more pairs of eyes to keep track potentially interesting projects. I also think the starting
* list Clare is not overwhelming, since a lot of the materials are from Stanford/Coursera, the same educational system where I came from.
