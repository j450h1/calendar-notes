# Introduction to this week's notes
As of last week (May 17, 2014), I finally finished a 20 week (10 weeks EdX active learning + 10 weeks knowledge vault summarization) stretch of the course ["Introduction to Statistical Learning with R"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). As I ramp down the effort, I think this is a good time to take a breath first search approach and investigate some of the interesting DS materials out there. This week's transition period is meant to investigate which courses are worth-while for my next phase of exploration.

## The Open-Source Data Science Masters
* **Description**: This is a github repo that keeps track of all the Data Science related resources that one can learn from internet, MOOC, textbooks...etc. The project was initiated by Clare Corthell, a Stanford-educated engineer. 
* **Why this is on my radar**: I love the idea of crowd-sourcing DS learning materials -- There is only so much that I can do alone. Users can contribute to the project by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo, making changes, and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). This is a pretty powerful collective efforts, because I have more pairs of eyes to keep track potentially interesting projects. I also think the starting list Clare is not overwhelming, since a lot of the materials are from Stanford/Coursera, the same educational system where I came from.

### Some potentially interesting courses

* [**MIT/EdX XSeries**](https://www.edx.org/xseries): In particular, I think the "Foundation of Computer Science" track is of my interest. Within the track, [6.00.1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-1x-introduction-computer-1841#.U4JfpFhdW84), and [6.002x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-2x-introduction-computational-1505) are of particular interests
to me. 6.00.1x will be offered pretty soon in June 11, 2014, but unfortunately 6.00.2x will not be offered in the short term (registration is closed). Lastly, the 6.00.1x course has an MIT OCW version available [here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/index.htm).

* [Time Series by Charlotte Wickham](http://stat565.cwick.co.nz/): I've always wanted to take a time series course. This was on my radar for a while, but honestly, for the pure reason that the instructor is Hadley Wickham's sister. I am not sure if the quality of the course is good. I would imagine it would be a bit more difficult to follow this course, since it doesn't have the MOOC format (with videos).

* [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web by Scott Murray](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345): I am always interested in data visualization and have always wanted to learn D3.js. I have heard talks from Scott Murray and he seems to be an expert on the subject matter. Earlier last year, he commented that he will be writing an O'reilly book, and I think this book (linked above) is the one. Looking at the table of contents, it seems like topic such as HTML, css,
DOM, Javascript, and D3.js specific materials are covered. It also seems like there is a step by step "how to set up D3.js section". Finally, he commented that this book is ideal whether "you're a designer or visual artist with no programming experience, a reporter exploring the frontier of data journalism". I think this means that even novice programmer can get started!
