# Introduction to this week's notes
As of last week (May 17, 2014), I finally finished a 20 weeks (10 weeks EdX active learning + 10 weeks knowledge vault summarization) stretch of the course "Introduction to Statistical Learning with R". As I ramp down the effort, I think this is a good time to take a breath first search approach and investigate some of the interesting DS materials out there. This week's transition period is meant to investigate which courses are worth-while for my next phase of exploration.

# The Open-Source Data Science Masters
* **Description**: This is a github repo that keeps track of all the Data Science related resources that one can learn from internet, MOOC, textbooks...etc. The project was initiated by Clare Corthell, a Stanford-educated engineer. 
* **Why this is on my radar**: I love the idea of crowd-sourcing DS learning materials -- There is only so much that I can do. Users can contribute to the project and [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo, making changes, and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
