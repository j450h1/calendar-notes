** The Open-Source Data Science Masters
* Description: This is a github repo that keeps track of all the Data Science related resources that one can learn from internet, MOOC, textbooks...etc. The project was initiated by Clare Corthell, a Stanford-educated engineer. 
* Why this is on my radar: I love the idea of crowd-sourcing DS learning materials -- There is only so much that I can do. Users can contribute to the project and forking the repo, making changes, and submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
