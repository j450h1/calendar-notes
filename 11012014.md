#### Try JQuery from CodeSchool

* **Level 1: Selecting DOM elements using jQuery**
	
	* Remember DOM loading is asynchronous, so we should write `jQuery(document).ready(function() {});` to first load the DOM, and when it is ready, execute whatever function we need to execute.

	* Remember CSS selectors `# id` for id and `.class` for class.

	* Selection in JQery is often short-handed as `$(".class")` or `$("# id")`


* **Level 2: Searching the DOM**

	* Descendant selector: `$("parent descendant")` will select all childTag that is nested under parentTag.

		* Selecting first and last children: `$("#destinations li:first")` and `$("#destinations li:last")`
		* Selecting even or odd elements: `$("#destinations li:odd")` and `$("#destinations li:even")`

	* Selecting only direct children: `$("parent > descendant")` will only select "direct children", nested ones will not be included. See page 52/187 of PDF.

	* Selecting multiple elements: `$(".promo, #france")`

	* Filtering by traversing: `$("#destinations").find("li")`. Notice syntax here, `$("#destinations")` is the selection, `.find("li")` is the traversal. This will find all (including nested) children. If you only want the direct children, use `$("#destinations").children("li")`.
		
		* `$("li").first()` instead of `$("li:first");` 
		* `$("li").last()` instead of `$("li:last");` 

	* We can also walk through the DOM: `$("li").first().next();` to find the middle element. `$("li").first().next().prev();` get you back to the first element.

	* Sometimes we are at a child node, and we wish to know the parent. `$("li").first().parent()` would give you the "li" parent node.


* **Level 3: Working with (Manipulate) the DOM**: The goal here is to have 3 panes, when clicked on the button, the corresponding price will be revealed.

	* Append a new node to the DOM (see page 76 - 79):
		* before(<element>) place the new node before the selected node, both nodes are in the same 'generation'/'level'
		* after(<element>) does the same, but put it after.
		* prepend(<element>) place the new node as the very first child node of the selected node. They are not at the same level.
		* append(<element>) place the new node as the very last child node of the selected node. They are not at the same level.

	* Acting on interaction using event listener. Notice how we have two nested callback function:
		* the first one is called upon when DOM is ready
		* the second one is an event listener that is triggered when button is clicked.
	  ```javascript
		$(document).ready(function() {
   			$('button').on('click', function() {
     			var price = $('<p>From $399.99</p>');
     			$('.vacation').append(price);
     			$('button').remove();
			}); 
		});
	  ```

	* 3.3: refactor using traversing - this will get us to almost what we want, click on button, price revealed (except all prices are the same).
		* Using `this`. In event listener, "this" is often the element that an event was triggered on (i.e. the user clicked on the 'button'). "this" keyword gives us a handy way to find a point of reference, and write codes that only affect DOM elements that are in local proximity.
		* using `.closest(<selector>)` to pick the most adjacent parent node. This is often a good way to prepend/append if the DOM structure is deeply nested. 
			* It will find 0 or 1 node, as for `.parents()`, it will find all nodes that fit the criteria, so you use that locality.

	* 3.4: traversing and filtering - we will finall be able to reveal pane specific prices.
		* `.data(<name>)` or `.data(<name>, <value>)` to get and set the data in a DOM element.
		* Event delegation: `javascript$('.vacation').on('click', 'button', function() {});`. We would only listen for click events, inside the vacation class, that are buttons specifically.


* **Level 4: On DOM load**: This level teachs you richer set of listeners and actions (that manipulate DOM elements) that comes after that

	* To show a DOM element, remember the default css style is usually that `display: none`.
	
	* Often, you need to use the idom `$(this).closest('.parent class').find('.element you want').action()` where
		* this line usually happens within the callback function of a listener
		* action can be `.slideDown()`, `.slideUp()`, or `.slideToggle()`
		* We can often wrap the line above into a callback function, so all we need to do is `.on('action', 'element', yourFunction)`. This makes the code cleaner. Make sure it's yourFunction instead of `yourFunction()`, otherwise it will be called immediately.

	* We have talkd about `click`, but there are much more. see slide 132. 
		* Some of the common ones are `mouseover`, `mouseleave`, and `mouseenter`.
		* Other ones are keyboard events, like `keypress`, `keydown`, `keyup`.

	* Link Layover (a bit confusing to me)
		* `event.stopPropagate()`: The browser will still handle the click event but will prevent it from “bubbling up” to each parent node.
		* 'event.preventDefault()': The click event will “bubble up” but the browser won’t handle it. 
		* Not really sure the difference between the two :(


* **Level 5**: Taming CSS

	* To style something based on interaction, we will need CSS and Javascript to work together.
		
		* To change the css style, we can pass in a JSON key,value pair just like we do in d3.js
		
		* However, it's often bad practice to place CSS code in your js coode. It's better to move styles to external CSS and wrap what we want as a class (see slide 167). You can then use addClass, removeClass, or even better, `toggleClass` to make your style change interactive. `hasClass` is handy if you have some control flow.

	* Animation, it very briefly take about how in `.animation()`, you can adjust the speed of the animation. This is similar to the `.duration()` function in d3.
