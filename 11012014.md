#### Try JQuery from CodeSchool

* **Level 1: Selecting DOM elements using jQuery**
	
	* Remember DOM loading is asynchronous, so we should write `jQuery(document).ready(function() {});` to first load the DOM, and when it is ready, execute whatever function we need to execute.

	* Remember CSS selectors `# id` for id and `.class` for class.

	* Selection in JQery is often short-handed as `$(".class")` or `$("# id")`

* **Level 2: Searching the DOM**

	* Descendant selector: `$("parent descendant")` will select all childTag that is nested under parentTag.

		* Selecting first and last children: `$("#destinations li:first")` and `$("#destinations li:last")`
		* Selecting even or odd elements: `$("#destinations li:odd")` and `$("#destinations li:even")`

	* Selecting only direct children: `$("parent > descendant")` will only select "direct children", nested ones will not be included. See page 52/187 of PDF.

	* Selecting multiple elements: `$(".promo, #france")`

	* Filtering by traversing: `$("#destinations").find("li")`. Notice syntax here, `$("#destinations")` is the selection, `.find("li")` is the traversal. This will find all (including nested) children. If you only want the direct children, use `$("#destinations").children("li")`.
		
		* `$("li").first()` instead of `$("li:first");` 
		* `$("li").last()` instead of `$("li:last");` 

	* We can also walk through the DOM: `$("li").first().next();` to find the middle element. `$("li").first().next().prev();` get you back to the first element.

	* Sometimes we are at a child node, and we wish to know the parent. `$("li").first().parent()` would give you the "li" parent node.

* **Level 3: Working with (Manipulate) the DOM**: The goal here is to have 3 panes, when clicked on the button, the corresponding price will be revealed.

	* Append a new node to the DOM (see page 76 - 79):
		* before(<element>) place the new node before the selected node, both nodes are in the same 'generation'/'level'
		* after(<element>) does the same, but put it after.
		* prepend(<element>) place the new node as the very first child node of the selected node. They are not at the same level.
		* append(<element>) place the new node as the very last child node of the selected node. They are not at the same level.

	* Acting on interaction using event listener. Notice how we have two nested callback function:
		* the first one is called upon when DOM is ready
		* the second one is an event listener that is triggered when button is clicked.
	  '''{javascript}
		$(document).ready(function() {
   			$('button').on('click', function() {
     			var price = $('<p>From $399.99</p>');
     			$('.vacation').append(price);
     			$('button').remove();
			}); 
		});
	  '''

	* 3.3: refactor using traversing - this will get us to almost what we want, click on button, price revealed (except all prices are the same).
		* Using `this`. In event listener, "this" is often the element that an event was triggered on (i.e. the user clicked on the 'button'). "this" keyword gives us a handy way to find a point of reference, and write codes that only affect DOM elements that are in local proximity.
		* using `.closest(<selector>)` to pick the most adjacent parent node. This is often a good way to prepend/append if the DOM structure is deeply nested. 
			* It will find 0 or 1 node, as for `.parents()`, it will find all nodes that fit the criteria, so you use that locality.

	* 3.4: traversing and filtering - we will finall be able to reveal pane specific prices.
		* `.data(<name>)` or `.data(<name>, <value>)` to get and set the data in a DOM element.
		* Event delegation: '''$('.vacation').on('click', 'button', function() {});'. We would only listen for click events, inside the vacation class, that are buttons specifically.
