### Notes for Today

#### Coursera: Practical Machine Learning: Week 4

Again, the introduction here is very superficial, so I am not quite sure what notes to take here.

* Regularized Regression: Briefly talk about the idea of bias-variance-trade-off. Explain how by giving up a bit of bias, we are able to reduce variance significantly.

* Combining prediction functions:
	* Random forest, bagging, boosting: combining similar prediction functions
	* Model stacking: like the Netflix price: combining completely different models

* Forecasting: Not a bad read. It also mentioned Rob Hyndman's Forecasting: principles and practice, which I have read in the past

* Unsupervised prediction: Sometimes you don't know the labels for prediction, so to build a predictor, we can:
	* create clusters
	* name clusters
	* build predictor for clusters
	* in a new data set, predict clusters

#### Coursera: Mining Massive Data Set (MMS): Week 1: just the Map-reduce part

It seems like a good start, but I am still evaluating whether to go through with it or not. Hold-off to summarizing the lectures.
