## Introduction

* Deep Work v.s. Shallow Work 
    
    * Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts crete new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

    * Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-stype tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

* The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill and then mak it the core of their working life, will thrive.

## Deep Work Is Valuable

* On Being Valuable: Two Core Abilities For Thriving In The New Economy
    1. The ability to quickly master hard things: Deliberate practice
    2. The ability to produce at an elite leve, in terms of both quality and speed: high-quality work produced = time spent * intensity of focus

    The two core abilities just described depend on your ability to perform deep work. Watch out for "Attention residue" - when switching from some task A to another task B, your attention doesn't immeidately follow. A residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. 

## Deep Work Is Rare

* Reasons Why Deep Work Is Rare
    * Metric Black hole: A lot of things are hard to measure, and therefore ignored.
    * The principle of least ressitance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment. 
    * Busyness As A Proxy For Productivity: In the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner.
    
    The principle of least resistance, protcted from scrutiny by the metric black hole, supports work cultures that is shallow.
