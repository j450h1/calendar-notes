#### Coursera: Developing Data Product

Since I am interested in building a small shiny app that interacts with Vertica to do data pull on user list (user set generation), I want to quickly review what Shiny is. I went through the week 1 materials that are Shiny related, but I am sure the Rstudio documentation would have more. I also have done something similar when I was at WaPo Labs for one of the hackweek project. You can refer to that code as well.
