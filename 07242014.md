### Notes for Today

## Coursera Data Science Series: "Statistical Inference"
* **Week 1**:
	* [**Paramount concerns of statistical inference**](http://bcaffo.github.io/courses/06_StatisticalInference/01_01_Introduction/#1):
		* Is the sample representative of the population?
		* Are there known and observed, known and unobserved or unknown and unobserved variables that contaminate our conclusions?
		* Is there a systematic bias created by missing data or the design or conduct of the study?
		* What randomness exists in the data and how do we use or adjust for it?
		* Are we trying to estimate an underlying mechanistic model of phenomena under study?
	* Tools of trade:
		* Randomization: balancing unobserved variables that may confound inference
		* Random sampling: obtaining data that is representative of the population
		* Sampling models: creating a modle for the sampling process
		* Hypothesis testing: decision making under uncertainty
		* Confidence interval: quantify uncertainty in estimation
		* Probaiblity model: formal connection between data generation from the population
		* Study design: the process of designing an experiment to minimize biases and variability
		* nonparametric bootstrapping: use existing data, with minimial prob model to create inference
		* Permutation, randomization and exchangeability testing: the process of using data permutation to perform inferences
	* It then started talking about:
		* Basic Probability
		* Random Variables, densities and PMFs
		* Distirbution functions and quantiles
		* Expected values
		* Continuous RV, rules for expectation
		* Variances
		* Basic Independence
		* Conrrelation, Variances and i.i.d RVs
		* sample variance
	I will not take notes here partly because:
		* These are very basic probabilities that I know by heart
		* It's rather hard to take LaTeX style notes on here github markdown (after my quick Google Search)
