### Notes for Today

Today's note is a bit scatter, since I am mostly catching up and cleaning what I have done on Monday and Tuesday.

* Coursera: Regression Class: Finished up the week 2 documentation, filling in the missing part in Multivariate regression (02_01_a to 02_01_d). I did this simply because there were too much materials in one day.

* Coursera: Web application Architecture: Finished week 4: The Ruby programming language. I deliberately left some to Wednesday from Monday because I am using the technique of inter-leaving
