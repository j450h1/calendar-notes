### How to start a start-up: Lecture 3: Paul Graham

* Start-ups are very counter-intuitive
	* If you follow your instincts, you will lead things astray
	* You can, however, trust instincts about people. Make sure you trust more about your instincts on people. Working with people who you genuinely enjoy work with, and know for a long time.
	* To succeed in start-up, you don't need expertise, the most important thing is to understand your users (not raising an angel round). To make something useful.
	* Don't just go through the motions of a start-up. 
	* Don't just look for the trick. 
	* Start-up is where gaming the system stops working.
	* There are parts of the world where gaming the system matters less than others, and there are some where it rarely matters. This is important for planning your future.
	* Start-ups are all consuming: it will take over your life, to a degree you cannot imagine. It never gets easier. Total number of worries never decreases. 
	* General advice: do not start a start-up when you are in shcool. Reasoning: you need to know your user -> you won't know your users until you build something -> builing a start-up is time consuming -> this means by definition you will not have the time to be a studnet.
	* Start a start-up is a great experience to life, but it's just part of the bigger question of building a good life. 
	* Success takes a lot of serendipity from life.
	* If you want to do start-up, what do you do in school:
		* Find good ideas
		* Find good co-founder
	* If you consciously try to find good ideas, then you are unlikely to find it. You have to unconsciously find good ideas as side project and eventually turn into real start-up. How do you turn your mind into the idea of start-ups unconsciously:
		* Learn a lot about things that matter
		* Work on things that interest you
		* Work with people you respect
	* JUST LEARN is the ultimate advice for college students.
