### Notes for Today

#### Continue the Path of d3.js

I think d3, and data visualization in general, has a unique place in the data scientist's toolkit because one is able to visibly showcase the data and the hardwork. Great public visualization often stir a lot of interest, and is one of the best way to share insights and build personal reputation.


For the longest time, I wanted to learn d3.js but didn't take actions. Scott Murray's [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web] was the turning point. His explanation was immensely friendly and the pace was just right for me to keep learning. Recently, I found out that this book was also used by [Harvard CS 171]'s visualization course! I can almost surely say that this is best book to get started with d3.js.


I spent about 2 months to finish his book (from 7/7/2014 - 8/30/2014). With all the codes available on github, I took it slowly and followed most of the exercises -- A great accomplishment indeed. However, I know that I also have the tendency to just drop a topic and move on to some other things, so the "chunk" that I developed are often not solid enough.


Since this is skill that I want to actively develop, I have been thinking how to continue my work around d3.js. In particular:

* **I found Harvard CS 171, and its six part lab. All the codes are available on github, and I plan to finish it all. The current schedule is to**
	* Go over one lab per week (on Saturday)
	* Hack something interesting on Sunday, preferably a longer term project. 

* **Furthermore, I want to take this opportunity to learn more web development. The recent run of Coursera: web architecture is good, but I am not going to learn if I don't build something**. 
	
	* Right now, the mentality is to learn web application for the purpose of building data visualizations. Maybe this skill can be extended in building dashboards as well!
	
	* Specifically, I want to learn more about the frontend technology:
		* JQuery
		* Backbone.js
		* There are probably more .js that I can learn down the line.

This is a new territory, but helps are within my reach - I should reach out to Krist, Robert Harris, and Guan Cheng as they are all experts on d3.

#### Harvard CS 171 Lab 3

The entirety of the lab 3 content is [here]. The major concept that was covered are:

* Scales and Axis
* Transitions
* Staggering Animations

Nothing that is more difficult than what was covered than Scott Murray's book, so I will not summarize the details here.

#### Some additional exploration around d3.js
There are several concepts/themes that I have in mind, which I am not sure how to achieve at this point.

* **Reading data from a database (e.g. MySQL) and load it in for d3 to visualize?**
	* I found some examples online, and the basic takeaways seems like the following: You write a script in php, Python ... etc to interact with the database, then you load the data and convert it into a json form. Finally, in javascript, you use the `ds.json('script.php', callback_function())` to process your data. Here are some examples:
		* [Using d3 with a MySQL database]
		* Similarly, I guess I can do the same thing using Python, here is a specific example I found online -- [Generate JSON from SQL Using Python]
		* [Using MySQL database as a source of data]. Check out the following two sections:
			* Using php to extract json from MySQL (pg. 147)
			* Getting the data into d3.js (pg. 150)
		* I still need to find an example where user enter arguments -> arguments passed on to the query -> grab the data -> return to d3 -> visualization. How does that work? ...

* **Using JQuery in conjunction with d3 and make the visualization more interactive?**
	* I literally only have 30 minutes exposure to JQuery by then, but I have a sense that it is awfully similar to d3's syntax. I don't know -- perhaps they can be used together to create more interactive visualizations. Not sure, but I thought it might be worthwhile to learn JQuery (I was shocked by the magic moment that I can just remove DOM elements like that!)
	* I then found out codeschool has a nice, free, intro course to JQuery called "try JQuery" (like "try Git"). The complete PDF for the course is available under ./images section.
		* I've completed level 1, and it's pretty good so far.
		* Seems like [kickass] has some materials on codeschool. Please respect copyrights.

* **What the hell is backbone.js**
	* It is still unclear to me, but what this came to mind because I found a [Quora post] about this. 
	* A long list of [real world projects] that are powered by backbone.js, including rdio, Hulu, Quartz, Foursquare, Khan Academy, Disqus, ZocDoc..etc.
	* This technology is probably down the line, I'll search more materails and learn how Javascript, JQuery, backbone.js are all related to each other.

* **There are also real time d3 dashboard**:
	* Completely blew my mind, but I don't think I am there yet. Square's [cubism.js] is cool.

* [Quora d3.js topic] is cool, but I haven't found anything specific tha is enlightening yet after Scott Murray's book.
