### Notes for Today

Today we focus on Coursera's web architecture week 5 materials from the second half, specifically, we look at:

* [**The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L5-MVC-Handout.pdf)

	* Early web application architectures did not have much organization, since its primary function was to fetch static web pages, and there was no separation between data from its presentation (they are just static page after page, with no data component embedded in the page)

	* The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural design pattern emerge for web 2.0 and 3.0 as a means of dealing with this emerging complexity. It **decouples** data (model) and presentation (view), with the controller as the middlema nto handle requests, and coordinate between the model and the view.

	* Here is an illustration of the MVC design pattern: ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/MVC.png)

	* A description of a typical MVC control flow can be found in slide 4/4.


* [**Rails Controllers - Request handling**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L6-RailsControllers-Request-Handout.pdf)

	* Recall:
		* The "M" in MVC are supported by the Ruby _ActiveRecord_ module in Rails. 
		* Views and Controllers in Rails are supported by _ActionPack_, which consists of three Ruby modules: _ActionDispatch_, _ActionController_, and _ActionView_.
		* Controllers are the heart of a Rails application - when a user connects to your Rails application and makes a user request, they do it by asking the application to execute a controller action.

	* How does Rails determine which controller action it will execute?
		* Using **Dispatcher**!: When an HTTP request is made to a Rails application, the _ActionDispatch_ module is used to map that request to a particular controller action.
		* This mapping is done via the _routes_ defined in `./config/routes.rb` file. 
		* As an example, we can add `get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'` to `./config/routes.rb`, which will map a GET request that use the URL `http://localhost:3000/products/10` to the `view` method in the `CatalogController` class.

	* A slight digression: RESTful Controllers:
		* in `routes.rb`, some routes are in the form `resources: posts`, this means that Rails controllers are **RESTful** and therefore use _resource routing_. 
		* The fundamental philosophy behind REST is that clients should communicate with servers through stateless connections, where:
			* long term state is kept on the server side by maintaining a set of identifiable resources, _posts_ and _comments_ in our case. 
			* The client can access these resources (perform CRUD operations) through a highly limited but uniform interface (HTTP protocol interface).
			* REST stands for Representational State Transfer -- we modify the states using HTTP verbs on server side resources, and make transfers of those resources through HTTP protocol.
			* **RESTful framework assumes a simple set of verbs (actions/methods/CRUD operations) that can operate over a rich set of nouns (resources).**

	* See how `resources :posts` produces seven different routes in your application, all mapping to methods in the PostController class in slide 7/7.


* [**Rails Controllers - Response**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L7-RailsControllers-Response-Handout.pdf)

	* Basic flow: once the HTTP request is routed to the appropriate class and its corresponding methods (for actions). The method (e.g. show) will execute and use `ActiveRecord#find` method to retrieve the post -> the post then is stored in a instance variable -> the controller will pass this instance variable onto view for rendering.

	* Rendering: we can render the data with different format, typically it's a HTML page for web application. But for APIs, typically, the rendering format is in .json form. This can be specified when the request is made (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/posts/1.json`).

	* Some additional concepts:

		* Also talked about the concept of Filters (like decorator in Python?) which allows controllers to run shared pre and post processing code over their methods.

		* Sessions: In general, web application are "stateless" (?)
			* Long term state that need to persist across requests should be stored in databases (posts and comments). 
			* In order to make certain information available across different requests, the concept of **session** is created.
			* Whenever a user coonects to a Rails application, a session is created. Session data is stored in Rails using a hash structure that persists **across requests**, and can be accessed by controllers.


* [**MVC implementation in Rails**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L8-MVC-Rails-Handout.pdf):

	* Model - The `ActiveRecord` class implements object-relational mappings (ORM)
	
	* View - views and controllers are actually bundled together in Rails in `ActionPack (_ActionDispatch_|_ActionController_|_ActionView_)`. Dynamic content is generated by templates containing embedded Ruby (Erb) code supported by the `ActionView` class.
	
	* Controller - The `ActionController` class is the core of a web request in Rails. It consists of one or more actions that are executed on request and then reither render a tempalte or redirect to another action.

	* The MVC interaction control flow can't be made more clear than ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/MVC_in_rails.png)

I think for a long time, I don't really know the MVC (Model-View-controller) Design pattern. Recently, I encountered the post written by Jeff Knupp, which is a fairly good explanation.

* [**What is a web framework?**](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/)


From Jeff's post, it seems like an important concept to understand web framework/application is how HTTP comes into play. It is essentially the de factor protocol that enables the communications between server-client model. This concept, in my opnion, is the very first step in understanding how web application works. 


Furthermore, the application of HTTP protocl can be extended to designing RESTful APIs, and here some of the materials I found on RESTful framework.
