### Notes for Today

Today we focus on Coursera's web architecture week 5 materials from the second half, specifically, we look at:

* [**The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L5-MVC-Handout.pdf)

* Rails Controllers - Request handling
* Rails Controllers - Response
* MVC implementation in Rails

---
I think for a long time, I don't really know the MVC (Model-View-controller) Design pattern. Recently, I encountered the post written by Jeff Knupp, which is a fairly good explanation.

* [**What is a web framework?**](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/)


From Jeff's post, it seems like an important concept to understand web framework/application is how HTTP comes into play. It is essentially the de factor protocol that enables the communications between server-client model. This concept, in my opnion, is the very first step in understanding how web application works. 


Furthermore, the application of HTTP protocl can be extended to designing RESTful APIs, and here some of the materials I found on RESTful framework.

* [**RESTful API explained**](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-http-and-rest--net-16340)
