### Notes for Today

Today we focus on Coursera's web architecture week 5 materials from the second half, specifically, we look at:

* [**The Model-View-Controller Design Pattern**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M5-L5-MVC-Handout.pdf)

	* Early web application architectures did not have much organization, since its primary function was to fetch static web pages, and there was no separation between data from its presentation (they are just static page after page, with no data component embedded in the page)

	* The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural design pattern emerge for web 2.0 and 3.0 as a means of dealing with this emerging complexity. It **decouples** data (model) and presentation (view), with the controller as the middlema nto handle requests, and coordinate between the model and the view.

	* Here is an illustration of the MVC design pattern: ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/MVC.png)

	* A description of a typical MVC control flow can be found in slide 4/4.

I think for a long time, I don't really know the MVC (Model-View-controller) Design pattern. Recently, I encountered the post written by Jeff Knupp, which is a fairly good explanation.

* [**What is a web framework?**](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/03/03/what-is-a-web-framework/)


From Jeff's post, it seems like an important concept to understand web framework/application is how HTTP comes into play. It is essentially the de factor protocol that enables the communications between server-client model. This concept, in my opnion, is the very first step in understanding how web application works. 


Furthermore, the application of HTTP protocl can be extended to designing RESTful APIs, and here some of the materials I found on RESTful framework.
