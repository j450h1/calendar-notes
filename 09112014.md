### Notes for Today

Today we will cover the last section of the web application architecture class. 

* [Dynamic Content, Templates and Layout]

	* In Rails, a controller makes every instance variable it creates available to the associated view files. Remember the `@posts` example.
	* In Rails, dynamic contents are generated using templates, and the most common templating framework is Embedded Ruby (ERb).
		* Contents between <%= and => is interpreted as Ruby code and executed, with the results substituted back into the files as a string in place of `<%= ... =>` string.
		* Content between `<% and %>` is interpreted as Ruby code and executed, but the results are not substituted back into the output file.
	
	* Application-level functionality and business logic should never be foudn in ERb template.

	* In order to generate the final HTML file that will be supplied to the browser, a layout file is invoked, passing the template to it as a block. By editing one file, and its associated sytlesheet, we can change the look and feel of the entire site. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/html_file.png)

* [Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)]

	* Displaying of a HTML page requires, fetching CSS and script files, along with external source, sythesize everything and parse them into a DOM (document object model), then the client renders the page. ![alt text](https://github.com/robert8138/Calendar_Notes/blob/master/images/display_html_document_3.png)

	* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language for specifying the presentation semantics of an HTML document (Again, remember the design principle of separation of content and presentation). It involves creating rules that specify how particular HTML elements should appear. Check out this [site].

	* A CSS rule has the following syntax `selector {property:value}` where (Note: invalid CSS rules are simply ignored)
		
		* selector - specifies the elements the rule will be applied to
			* class selector: all elements with the same class will be subject to the styling rule `div.main { or .main {`
			* type selector: applies to elements of a given type `h1 {`
			* id selector: applies to elements with a given id. `#unique_id`. Remember, each id is unique in a HTML page!
			* More selectors can be found [here]

		* declaration - a semicolon separated list of property:value pairs

	* There is also the *box model*, where CSS treats every element as a box, and allows you to specify padding, margin, border. CSS can also be used to control the positioning of the "boxes" on a page, therefore, page layout (I vaguely remember Twitter bootstrap is related to layouts?)


* [JavaScript and JQuery]

	* JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that was design to embedded within, and provide scripting capabilities to any application. 
		
		* **Client-side JavaScript** combines the scripting capabilities of the JavaScript interpreter with the DOM defind in the web browser, enabling executable content to be distributed over the web.

		* It's also possible to run JavaScript in other environment (**Node.js** is a server side JavaScript application for developing networking applications)

		* JavaScript is primarily used to write functions that are embedded in or included from HTML pages, for the purpose of dynamically modifying the HTML elements on client-side pages through DOM.

	* Because JavaScript code runs locally in the browser, it can quickly respond to user actions, making the web application as a whole more responsive. (e.g. update a portion of the webpage, perform client-side validations prior submitting data to the web app)

	* Put JavaScript in an HTML file, enclosed within the <script> tag, and render the file in your browser.

	* JavaScript Library:
		* The most popular JavaScript library is **JQuery**, it supports the notion of unobtrusive JavaScript - the separation of _behavior_ from document _structure_. This means that you never embed _any_ JavaScript expressions or statements within the body of an HTML document, either as attributes of HTML elements or in script blocks.
		* JQuery solves a large degree, work consistency across browsers
		* Elements are retrieved vai selectors (just like d3) `jQuery(<selector>)` or `$(<selector>)` -- this function returns a JavaScript object containing an array of DOM elements that match the selector (again, just like d3).
		* You can ten apply operations or chains of operations to them `$("div.byebye").hid();` will hide all the div elements to the class bye-bye.

* [Ajax]
	
	* Ajax was originally an acronym that stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, but now it has evolved and deals with how various technologies come together in order to provide a more **interactive web browsing experiences**.

	* The basic idea is that it sends asynchronous HTTP requests to a web server and then load the server response data back into the script WHILE users are still interacting with the web app.

	* In spite of the name, Ajax can retrieve JSON, HTML, JavaScript or plain text. The data can be used to alter the current document shown in the browser.
