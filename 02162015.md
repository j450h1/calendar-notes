### Data Just Right Chapter 4 - Notes on Relational Databases & NoSQL Databases

* [Relational Databases and ACID]

	* Data model is that records are stored in tabluar form, schema is prefixed, and needs to satisfy a set of properties , known as **ACID**, that guarantee that transctions are processed reliably

		* **Atomiicity**: requires that each transaction be 'all or nothing': If one part of the transaction fails, the whole transation fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes.

		* **Consistency**: ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors cannot result in the violation of any defined rules.

		* **Isolation**: The ability to handle multiple transations at the same time without conflicts. It ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially.

		* **Durability**: means that the database will retain the lastk nown correct state. Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.

	* **Declarative Language** & **Physical Optimization**

		* The declarative nature of SQL allows the user to focus on the logical expression instead of the physical algorithms that carry out the data retrieval task.

		* SQL is about "WHAT" and not the "HOW"

		* Queries can be expressed as a sequence of operations in a tree structure, but in practice we don't think about the underlying execution plan when writing SQL.

One of the many reasons that the relational database concept became the dominant form of data management is that it strives to provide a great deal of data **consistency**. Furthermore, much of the growth of open-source database MySQL was due to the availability of easy-to-use integrations with Web-friendly scripting languages such as Perl and PHP, creating a new era with flourishing web applications.

However, as the user base of a web site grows, so does the need to handle the scale of data. Some of the early Web pioneers such as Amazon and Google found that relational databases were not always the right tool for the job. i.e. The priorities of existing relational database systems were geared more toward **consistency** than **availability**.

* [CAP Theorem and BASE]

Imagine the Web site has gone viral and that millions of users access this online system at all times. How can we handle the scale? With computing prices dropping every day, servers and hard disks are available to handle quite a lot of transactional processing. At some point, a single machine might not be able to handle the load of many thousands of queries every second. Furthermore, Web traffic, log data, and other factors may mean that, over time, it might not be possible to continually upgrade a single server. The need for higher capacity and plenty of data throughput requires other strategies.

Although commodity computer hardware tends to become cheaper over time, continually upgrading to more massive server hardware has been historically economically infeasible (AKA **scale vertically**). Spending twice as much money on a huge, single machine may not provide double the performance. In contrast, smaller, more modest servers remain inexpensive. In general, it makes more economic sense to **scale horizontally**: in other words, to simply add more cheap machines to the system rather than try to put a single relational database on one expensive, massive server.

In order to guarantee performance of this Web application, one might consider splitting the relational tables across a collection of machines. Perhaps _each table could reside on a different machine_; it might be possible to split, or **shard**, individual tables of a relational database system off to a dedicated server. At some point, the table with the most data might again become too large to host on a single machine. Situations like this create bottlenecks in our system. When faced with the onslaught of Web-scale data, the popular relational database model begins to create very challenging problems. With the hardware available, Codd’s idealized concepts of database design simply don’t support the realities of Web traffic.

In 2000, UC Berkeley professor and Inktomi co-founder Dr. Eric Brewer proposed a model for understanding how distributed computing systems such as a distributed database system might operate. Brewer’s conjecture begins by defining three important characteristics of distributed systems:

* **Consistency**: refers to the ability for reach machine to have access to exactly the same data at any given time.
* **Availability**: describes the ability of a system to respond to requests.
* **Partition tolerance**: a system can function successfully in the event of a partial failure. i.e. two slave nodes can still work independently to make progress even if it cannot establish contact with each other or the master node.

The conjecture of the CAP theorem is that one can only design a system that satisfy two of the properties, but not all three. Consider the case where a system has good availability and parition tolerance, meaning each machine can still make progress when connection is not lost, then consistency is violated because they might have written different values for the same record without the awareness.

Then comes **BASE**, short for "basically available, soft state, eventually consistent". In 2008, Dan Pritchett, then a technical fellow at eBay, published an ACM article entitled “BASE: An Acid Alternative,”1 in which he stated that while _“ACID is pessimistic and forces consistency at the end of every operation, BASE is optimistic and accepts that the database consistency will be in a state of flux.”_

In general, there are two types of NoSQL databases:

* **Key-Value Pairs Store**:
	
	* Pioneered by Amazon's Dynamo database, when data volumes gro, reading from and writing to a relational database while maintaining ACID compliance can be computationally expensive.

	* A key–value store looks a lot like a big hash table. Each record in the database is an object identified by a unique key. The value that is addressed by this key can basically be anything: a string, a JSON or XML document, a binary blob, or a number of other things.

	* A key characteristic of these databases is that the system doesn’t really know anything about the data being stored; all access to data comes from the key. Key–value stores are the right choice for applications that generally retrieve database information based on a single key.

	* **This design makes for very good performance for database writes.** Another advantage is that the design lends itself toward being easy to scale and replicate across a network of machines. Because each record in the database is simply a value addressed by a unique key, the data itself can reside on any machine on the network as long as the system knows how it can be located. One way to scale this type of database is to keep a secondary table of key-range to machine mappings. When a piece of data is defined, this table may be referred to by the secondary table and the request sent to the proper machine.

	* On the other hand, a general disadvantage of the design of a key–value store is that data cannot be accessed by value. In other words, it is impossible to query a key–value data store for all records that contain a particular set of values. The only way to query a key–value database is by specifying a request by key or, in some cases, a range of keys.

* **Document Store**:

	* A document store is a type of database that stores data as a collection of — you guessed it — documents. These documents themselves may be XML representations, JSON objects, and even specific binary formats. In contrast to a relational database — in which every record in a table must adhere to the same schema—a document store can contain a variety of records with completely different schemas. 

	* In other words, each record might have a completely different structure. Although this is also true of most key–value stores, the difference is that document stores usually allow the user to ask questions about the actual data in the database, rather than interrogating simply using the key.

	* A canonical example that illustrates the differences between a document store and a relational database can be found in serving the information necessary to construct a page for a typical blog. Blog pages not only feature page content and a title but also additional content such as an author name, links to related posts, and even user comments. If this information was stored in a relational database, the queries necessary to build a single page would require accessing a large number of tables.

	* The user of a document store takes a different approach; all of the content for a single page is stored in a single, large record. These records remain independent of one another, and changing one does not affect the rest of the blog post records. If one of the blog pages contains a completely different chunk of information (say, links to photo URLs for a slideshow), this information can be added to any document without worrying about the schema of the others. The relational database, on the other hand, would represent all of the information as relationships between existing, normalized tables.
