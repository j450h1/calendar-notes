### Notes for Today

* **Coursera: Web Application: Week 4: The Ruby Programming Language**: Ruby was developed with a focus on the programmer, rather than the machine. The design goal was to maximize programmer producitivity, not the runtime efficiency. Ruby is designed to make programmers happy, and is designed according to the Principle of Least Astonishment. Ruby is a multi-paradigm programming language: Scripting | Imperative (procedure-oriented programming) | Object-oriented programming | Functional Programming.


	* [**Classes and Inheritance**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L2-Ruby-ClassesInheritance-Handout.pdf)
		
		* Classes are defined with the keyword _class_, the convention is to use CamelCase. Within the class, we often have:

			* **Instance variable** - often start with @. e.g. @boo
			* **Methods** - using _def my_method_ (convention is to use snakecase)
				* Methods do not have return value, the value of the last expression executed in a method is the return value
				* Parentheses are optional in calling a method
				* In Ruby, the last character of a method name is often use to indicate behavior
					* If ends with a question mark, it indicates that the return value is boolean
					* If ends with an exclamation, it indicates that the method can change the state of the object.
				* Accessors shorthand is helpful! (see slide 9/10)
		
			* Class methods are created in the same way as normal method, except they are prefixed by the keyword self. e.g. _def self.my_class_method_.

		* Inheritance, Mixins and Extending classes:

			* Only single inheritance is supported. the mixin capability associated with _modules_ basically gives you multiple inheritance. Basically, we exposed all the common functionality in a module and made them available in class definitions.
				* You can create a module with its own namespace by using keyword _module_. You can include a module within another program by _require 'module_name'_.
				* Within a class, you use the keyword include to mixin a module. This makes all of the methods defined in that module a part of the class that includes the module.
			* Classes are never close, you can always add methods to an existing class.
			* The syntax for inheritance is _class NewClass < SuperClass_


		* Specifying Access:

			* public: no access control, can be called by anyone
			* protected: can only be invoke by objects of the defining class and its subclasses
			* private: can only be called in the context of the current object, without on object refverence on the LHS. (not conventional) The receiver of the a private method is always self. In layman's term, the private method only works on yourself!

			* Every method in a class is public, and every instance variable is protected.


	* [**Objects and variables**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L3-Ruby-ObjectsVariables-Handout.pdf):

		* Everything in Ruby is an object, and belongs to the Object class. Object class is the parent of all classes in Ruby.
		* Ruby does not use variable declaration! This means it uses **duck-typing**, which simply means that if something behaves, act like a duck, we call that thing a duck.
		* All assignments are done by reference. A varaible is just a pointer/reference to an object.
		* Ruby uses simple naming conventions:
			* name - could be a local variable
			* @name - an instance variable
			* @@name - a class variable
			* $name - a global variable


	* [**Strings, Regular expression and Symbols**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L4-Ruby-StringsRegexSymbols-Handout.pdf):

	* **Expressions and Control Structures**:

	* **Collections, Blocks and Iterators**:

I am deliberately leaving the remaining sections blank, because I want to revisit Ruby again this week. Remember the concept of inter-leaving!
