### Notes for Today

* **Coursera: Web Application: Week 4: The Ruby Programming Language**: Ruby was developed with a focus on the programmer, rather than the machine. The design goal was to maximize programmer producitivity, not the runtime efficiency. Ruby is designed to make programmers happy, and is designed according to the Principle of Least Astonishment. Ruby is a multi-paradigm programming language: Scripting | Imperative (procedure-oriented programming) | Object-oriented programming | Functional Programming.


	* [**Classes and Inheritance**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L2-Ruby-ClassesInheritance-Handout.pdf)
		
		* Classes are defined with the keyword _class_, the convention is to use CamelCase. Within the class, we often have:

			* **Instance variable** - often start with @. e.g. @boo
			* **Methods** - using _def my_method_ (convention is to use snakecase)
				* Methods do not have return value, the value of the last expression executed in a method is the return value
				* Parentheses are optional in calling a method
				* In Ruby, the last character of a method name is often use to indicate behavior
					* If ends with a question mark, it indicates that the return value is boolean
					* If ends with an exclamation, it indicates that the method can change the state of the object.
				* Accessors shorthand is helpful! (see slide 9/10)
		
			* Class methods are created in the same way as normal method, except they are prefixed by the keyword self. e.g. _def self.my_class_method_.

		* Inheritance, Mixins and Extending classes:

			* Only single inheritance is supported. the mixin capability associated with _modules_ basically gives you multiple inheritance. Basically, we exposed all the common functionality in a module and made them available in class definitions.
				* You can create a module with its own namespace by using keyword _module_. You can include a module within another program by _require 'module_name'_.
				* Within a class, you use the keyword include to mixin a module. This makes all of the methods defined in that module a part of the class that includes the module.
			* Classes are never close, you can always add methods to an existing class.
			* The syntax for inheritance is _class NewClass < SuperClass_


		* Specifying Access:

			* public: no access control, can be called by anyone
			* protected: can only be invoke by objects of the defining class and its subclasses
			* private: can only be called in the context of the current object, without on object reference on the LHS. (not conventional) The receiver of the a private method is always self. In layman's term, the private method only works on yourself!

			* Every method in a class is public, and every instance variable is protected.


	* [**Objects and variables**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L3-Ruby-ObjectsVariables-Handout.pdf):

		* Everything in Ruby is an object, and belongs to the Object class. Object class is the parent of all classes in Ruby.
		* Ruby does not use variable declaration! This means it uses **duck-typing**, which simply means that if something behaves, act like a duck, we call that thing a duck.
		* All assignments are done by reference. A varaible is just a pointer/reference to an object.
		* Ruby uses simple naming conventions:
			* name - could be a local variable
			* @name - an instance variable
			* @@name - a class variable
			* $name - a global variable


	* [**Strings, Regular expression and Symbols**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L4-Ruby-StringsRegexSymbols-Handout.pdf):

		* You can create **string** literals in Ruby using either single or double quote. 
			* Double quote is a little bit more powerful since we can insert arbitrary Ruby expression using string interpolation (e.g. "350 degree =#{2*Math::PI} radians").
			* If you use a string in single backquote, it will be excuted as a command. 
			* Strings in Ruby are mutable, thus, each time Ruby encounters a new string literal, it create a new String object. (I don't understand this part?)


		* **Regular expression (Regex)**: a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text. 
			* It's generally in the form _/pattern/modifiers_ where parttern is the regular expression itself, and modifier are a series of characters indicating various options. 
			* See **slide 5/8** for a partial list of special meanings in patterns.
			* In web application, regex are commonly used to validate emails, phone numbers, and other user-supplied input.

		* **Symbols**: a symbol is created if you precede a name with a colon (e.g. attr_reader :row :col)
			* Ruby symbols are used to represent names and strings; however unlike string objects, symbols of the same name are initialized and exist in memory only once during a Ruby session. Ruby symbols are immutable, and cannot be modified during runtime.
			* When should we use string v.s. symbols?
				* If the contents of the object is important e.g. if you need to manipulate these characters, use a string.
				* If the identity of the object is important (in which case you don't want to manipulate the characters), use a symbol.

	* [**Expressions and Control Structures**](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/webapplications/lecture_slides/M4-L5-Ruby-ExpressionsControl-Handout.pdf):

		* Everything in Ruby is treated as an **expression** and therefore evaluates to something. In Ruby, if, case, for structure return the value of the last expression evaluated within the structure.

		* There's _if_, _for_, _while_, _until_ **control structures**, which are good. But in Ruby, it's more common to use iterators (this is like the apply functions in R).


	* **Collections, Blocks and Iterators**:

		* **Collections**: Talk about Array and Hash classes, but there are more. Look at API documentation on the methods of these classes.
			* Each of these collectio nclasses includes the Enumerable module as a mxin. Thus, they share a common set of methods provided by Enumerable.
			* The Enumerable module provides iterator methods that can be used to iterate through (and operate on) each element in a collection.

		* **Blocks**: consists of a block of code, enclosed in curly braces, that can be passed as a parameter to a method. Remember functional programming!
			* Important rule: A block may appear only in the source code if it is adjacent to a method call (on the same line as the method call's last parameter). (e.g. three_times {put "hello"})

		* **Iterator**: the most common loop structure
			* The defining feature of an iterator method (it's a method!) is that it invokes a block of code, applying it to each element in a collection.
			* A collection class that includes the _Enumerable_ module is required to supply an _each_ method. This method must yield the successive memebers of the collection.
			* Iterator works because you can pass parameters into blocks. See the 2 examples, particularly the last one that mix iterator with HTML codes.
