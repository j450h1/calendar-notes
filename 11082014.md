#### d3.js Continued

Trying to get some inspiration, and came across the [Bay Area d3 User Group] again. They have a [youtube playlist] with all the recorded talks. In particular, I watched the first two from their meetup on 2/21/2013.

They also introduced another book, called [Getting Started with D3]. The Author Mike Dewar, I think, is affliated with Drew Conway and John Myles White, and seem like a data scientist. But again, I don't think this book is as comprephensive as Scott Murray's awesome book.

#### Misc

I am still struggling to find the right data set, but maybe the important thing is to get started. Here is my current thought, just take something like IMDB data set, and

* Use Python to scrape the data and metadata
* Use dplyr to practice how to manipulate these data into simple aggregation
* Use d3 to visualize a scatterplot with different dimension, maybe budget and box office sales number
* Finally, think about displaying metadata, or interactivity like brushing
