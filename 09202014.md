### Notes for Today

#### Harvard CS 171 Visualization Course: Lab 4

This is one of the worst labs that I have experienced. The main topic is about d3 layouts, but I find the lab hard to follow. Layouts seems to be helpful though (a lot of tree views (like the ones we have for client events) are using d3 layout).

I think the only take away for me is that d3 layout essentially does the following:

* You supply the basic data (e.g. a nested json form of nodes -- including root nodes and its childrens), d3 layout will provide additional attributes (e.g. positions of the nodes) for you.

* Once you have the nodes/links and their generated attributes, you will be able to bind these generated 'data' with visual elements and display them in a beautiful way (consider the diaganol line graph).

#### Coursera: Regression Model: Week 4: 2/2

Today's topic continue GLM, and specifically the [poisson GLM models]. 

* The Poisson distribution is a useful model for **counts** and **rates**. Here a rate is count per some monitoring unit time. Some example usages of poisson distribution:

	* Modeling web traffic hits
	* Incidence rate
	* Approximating binomial distribution with small p and large n
	* Analyzing contigency table data

* Characteristics of Poisson distribution:

	* Mean is often in the form \lambda* t where \lambda is the rate. Changing t would change the interpretation of \lambda.
	* The variance and mean are the same (both are \lambda * t)
	* The poisson tends to a normal as \lambda * t gets large.

* Jeff Leek's website traffic growth example:

	* We can model web traffic by linear regression, sometimes not a bad choice, but not so good when you have exponential growth in traffic.
	
	* We can also model the log(traffic), this is not the same as a poisson model (slide 12/23). 
		* The interpretation of \b1 becomes - increase in log number of hits per unit day.
		* e^\beta1 estimates relative increase/decrease in 'geometric mean' hits per day. (It's clear that it's estimating relative increase of a quantity, but I still don't understand semantically what e^E[log(Y)] = geometric mean. Why is this useful? When y_i's are percentages? 
			* Ok, I later found out a good example in [wiki - growing oranges]. In short, when your growth is in % year over year, taking arithemic averages would overstate the growth, so a geometric average is better!
			* Ahh, so e^\beta1 is the relative increase in the year over year (geometric) average out growth per unit change of the regressor 1.
			* **So this technique is good for modeling relative increase in rates**
	
	* Of course, we can also model `log(\mu) = b0 + b1 * x` or `expected count = e^(b0 + b1 * x)`, which is the possion model.
		* Notice that E[log(Y)] != log(\mu) = log(E(Y)). Remember Jensen's inequality?
		* **Expected** count is multiplied by `exp(b1)` for a one unit increase of regressor 1.
		* **So this model is good for modeling relative increase in expected count**

	* Alternatively, in the realm of poisson models, we can also estimate Expected rate (not the same as variant 2), using this concept call offset.
		* The formula derivation is pretty nice, I would see slide 20/23.
		* When offset is used, the interpretation of e^\beta1 becomes the relative increase of **expected rate**!

I am skipping the last lecture on splines, since I don't think they are good. See ISLR for review of splines.
