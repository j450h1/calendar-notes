### Notes for Today

I found out that the Coursera Data Science Specialization materials will expire once the class finishes. This is not the same for regular coursera courses. Therefore, I think it's a good idea to download these courses using the coursera-dl tool. (Do not redistribute the Coursera materials for commercial purposes).

## How to download a Coursera course

* First, go to [coursera-dl](https://github.com/dgorissen/coursera-dl) Github repo, and download the repo.
* Follow the instruction and install it.

* In my laptop, it's saved under the virtualenv-1.9 directory -> Coursera-dl
* Coursera-dl is a virtualenv directory, so I will need to source /bin/activate first for the commandline tool to work
* Under /virtualenv-1.9/Coursera-dl/bin, you will see the command line tool "coursera-dl"
* Use coursera-dl -h to make sure it works
* Once it works, start downloading the course "coursera-dl -u MYUSERNAME -p MYPASSWORD -d MYPATH algo-2012-001"
* I usually just type coursera-dl -u MYUSERNAME -p MYPASSWORD -d . algo-2012-001 to download things to my current directory
