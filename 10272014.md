#### Doing Data Science: Chapter 9: 1/2

The first part of Chapter 9 is about data visualization. I think they are deep and interesting, but perhaps a little bit too philosophical for me. The second part is from Ian Wong from Square, and I look forward to that section. Nothing notable to be put down in the notes.

#### Python notebook cookbook

Setting up ipython notebook is not easy, here are some of the steps that I took

```{python}
# In command line, create a new virtualenv
virtualenv new_virtual_environment

# Go into the directory, and activate the virtual env
cd bin; source activate;

# Start your pip install routines
pip install (ipython|numpy|pandas|matplotlib)

# Most likely it will fail. If the message is about missing compiler gcc 4.2, then the workaround is
ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" sudo pip install PACKAGE

# For ipython, the dependency is pyzmq, so we type
ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" sudo pip install pyzmq

# Sometimes we need tornado as well
pip install tornado

# Activate the ipython notebook server
ipython notebook
```  
##### 01_notebook.ipynb

* Use Shift+Enter to execute each cell
* _ contains the last returned value
* !CMD allows one to execute a command as if you are in bash
* %lsmagic allows one to execute special oeprations
* Markdowns to the next level: HTML, SVG, YoutubeVideo

##### 02_pandas.ipynb

* Very minimal intro to pandas, I don't think I learn much from here.

#### Misc

##### Update R version

Often time, you would want to install a package that requires a more recent version of the R base package. For example, you would like to install dplyr. To check your current version of R, type `R.version` in R console. If your version is lower than what is required, you will need to go to CRAN and download the newer version. Note, you have to go to CRAN, not R studio to update your R version.

##### Connecting to Vertica in Python
Use Uber's [vertica-python] package, this is much easier to set up compared to `pyodbc` (which I ran into a lot of problems). Follow the instruction in the README in the github repo:

```{python}
# In terminal
pip install vertica-python

# In iPython
from vertica_python import connect

connection = connect({
	'host': '127.1.2.3',
	'port': port_num,
	'user': 'your_name',
	'password': 'not_going_tell_you',
	'database': 'name_of_db'
})

cur = connection.cursor()

cur.execute("select * from table limit 10;")
rows = cur.fetchall()

connection.close()
```
