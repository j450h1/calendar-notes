#### Doing Data Science: Chapter 9: 1/2

The first part of Chapter 9 is about data visualization. I think they are deep and interesting, but perhaps a little bit too philosophical for me. The second part is from Ian Wong from Square, and I look forward to that section. Nothing notable to be put down in the notes.

#### Python notebook cookbook

Setting up ipython notebook is not easy, here are some of the steps that I took

```{python}
# In command line, create a new virtualenv
virtualenv new_virtual_environment

# Go into the directory, and activate the virtual env
cd bin; source activate;

# Start your pip install routines
pip install (ipython|numpy|pandas|matplotlib)

# Most likely it will fail. If the message is about missing compiler gcc 4.2, then the workaround is
ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" sudo pip install PACKAGE

# For ipython, the dependency is pyzmq, so we type
ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" sudo pip install pyzmq

# Sometimes we need tornado as well
pip install tornado

# Activate the ipython notebook server
ipython notebook
```  
##### 01_notebook.ipynb

* Use Shift+Enter to execute each cell
* _ contains the last returned value
* !CMD allows one to execute a command as if you are in bash
* %lsmagic allows one to execute special oeprations
* Markdowns to the next level: HTML, SVG, YoutubeVideo

##### 02_pandas.ipynb

* Very minimal intro to pandas, almost always just not helpful!
